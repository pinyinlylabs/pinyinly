# Curriculum Design for Pinyinly

Pinyinly is structured to teach Mandarin Chinese in a way that balances vocabulary, character recognition, and skill dependencies.

## Handling Words with Multiple Meanings

Words like **遍 (biàn)** have distinct meanings depending on context. Instead of merging them under one gloss, we split them into separate learning skills.

- **遍 as a measure word** → "I read this book three times."
- **遍 as 'everywhere'** → "He searched everywhere."

This approach ensures structured learning progression and prevents premature merging in SRS.

## Learning the meaning for a hanzi

Pinyinly takes the approach of teaching how to remember the meaning of a hanzi when you see it (i.e. read it) by using a few pieces of information:

- The breakdown of components in the character.
- The relative position or composition of those components.
- The meaning of those components.

As such Pinyinly teaches you hanzi in "bottom up" manner where by you learn basic hanzi and radicals first, followed by more complex hanzi that are composed of those components.

---

Pinyinly teaches you a short story or mnemonic that ties together the components of a hanzi to remember the meaning. This can work in a few ways:

- imagining something that **looks** like the character (for example 人 **looks** like a **person** walking, or 宀 **looks** like the side profile of a roof with a chimney)
- combining the meaning of the components (e.g. **ceremony** (礼) is a **spiritual ritual** (礻) that contains **hidden meaning** (乚))
- a combination of the two, i.e. conceptual + visual. (e.g. **use** (以) has a **person** on the right, and something on the left that you can imagine looks like a rake or plow, you can combine rake/plow + person = **use**)

### Example of learning the meaning of 变

变 (biàn) means **"to change"**, **"to transform"**, or **"to become different"**.

🧠 Quick breakdown:

| Aspect        | Info                     |
| ------------- | ------------------------ |
| Pinyin        | biàn                     |
| Core meanings | change; transform; alter |
| Extended uses | become; turn into        |

---

📚 Visual decomposition of 变:

| Part    | Meaning                                              |
| ------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| 亦 (yì) | also; too                                            |
| 攵 (pu) | action (variant of the "hand holding stick" radical) |

    •	亦 (yì) roughly means "also" — something additional.
    •	攵 is a common radical related to actions (like 攻 attack, 敏 quick).

So 变 combines the idea of taking action (攵) and something different/also (亦), resulting in the idea of changing, transforming from one state to another.

✅ Best glosses for your project:

• "change" (perfect short gloss)
• "transform" (for dramatic changes)
• "become different" (more detailed)

I'd recommend "change" for simplicity and accuracy.

### Example of learning the meaning of 掉

掉 (diào) means "to fall," "drop," "lose," or "remove", depending on the context — usually implying something is detached, let go, or no longer present.

🧩 Decomposition

掉 = ⿰扌卓
• 扌 → hand (component form of 手)
• 卓 → outstanding, prominent

⸻

🧠 Interpretation

A hand (扌) lets go of something high up (卓) — it falls, drops, or is lost.

This fits well with meanings like:
• 掉了 → "it dropped / was lost"
• 掉头 → "turn one's head" (lit. pivoting action)
• 掉下来 → "fall down"
• 掉进水里 → "fell into the water"

⸻

✅ Common glosses:
• "drop"
• "fall"
• "lose"
• "remove"
