# Pinyinly Spaced Repetition Algorithm

The SRS system dynamically adjusts review intervals based on a **trickle-down reinforcement** approach. This prevents premature reviews when related skills have already been practiced indirectly.

## Key Features

- **Graph-based reinforcement**: Practicing one skill subtly reinforces related skills.
- **Adjustable learning paths**: Users can prioritize listening, reading, or speaking skills.
- **Personalized difficulty scaling**: Adapts based on previous mistakes.
