# Contribution guide

## Setup

Install [proto](https://moonrepo.dev/proto):

```sh
curl -fsSL https://moonrepo.dev/install/proto.sh | bash
proto use
```

Now you can start the app:

1. `npx inngest-cli@latest dev`
1. `moon run app:dev`.
1. Scan the QR code on your phone.

# Guides

## Writing a backend database migration

1. Edit the Drizzle schema.
1. Run `moon run app:dbGenerate`

## Creating a PYLY_JWT_KEY_BASE64

```sh
openssl rand -base64 32
```

## Debugging Expo server

In VS Code open a `JavaScript Debug Terminal` from the command palette
<kbd>⌘</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>p</kbd>, then run commands as normal e.g.

```sh
moon run app:dev
```

This works because VS Code configures `NODE_OPTIONS` in the terminal to `--require` a special
`bootloader.js`, so it's important that moon tasks that define `NODE_OPTIONS` pass through the
existing value.

## Adding a cross project dependency

Add to `dependsOn:` within `moon.yml`, then run:

```sh
moon sync projects
```

This will update `package.json/dependencies`, `tsconfig.json/references`,
`tsconfig.json/compilerOptions/paths`.

## Upgrading Yarn

Inside `toolchain.yml` edit `node.yarn.version` and update the version. Run `moon sync projects` to
apply the change.

## Upgrading Moon

```sh
proto outdated --update
proto use
```

## Upgrading Proto

```sh
proto upgrade
```

## Upgrading Node.js

Edit `.moon/toolchain.yml` edit `node.version`.

```sh
moon run node-version
```

Moon will automatically synchronize `package.json` `engines.node`, and it will use proto to download
and install the right version of Node.js.

## Upgrading a transitive Yarn dependency (e.g. for security patch)

A normal `yarn up ___` won't work if no workspace depends on it directly, so you need to use
`--recursive`. For example to upgrade `tar` use:

```sh
yarn up -R tar
```

## Upgrading a dependency with a Yarn patch

Yarn doesn't automatically migrate patches, so you need to migrate it manually.

```sh
yarn patch expo-image
patch -d /private/var/folders/fs/...snip.../T/xfs-33350073/user < .yarn/patches/expo-image-npm-1.12.9-116d224baf.patch
yarn patch-commit -s /private/var/folders/fs/...snip.../T/xfs-33350073/user
rm .yarn/patches/expo-image-npm-1.12.9-116d224baf.patch
```

## Updating app icons

Icons can be exported directly from Figma. Frames are labelled appropriately such that everything in
Figma can be exported to the `projects/app/src/assets` directory.

## Writing Pinyin on macOS

1. Enable the `Pinyin - Simplified` keyboard.
1. Type the pinyin without the tone (e.g. `hao`).
1. Press <kbd>Tab</kbd> to cycle through each tone.
1. Press <kbd>Enter</kbd> to accept the pinyin.

Example: to write `hǎo` type <kbd>h</kbd> <kbd>a</kbd> <kbd>o</kbd> <kbd>Tab</kbd> <kbd>Tab</kbd>
<kbd>Tab</kbd> <kbd>Enter</kbd>.

## Local development with Sign in with Apple for Web

1. Set `EXPO_TUNNEL_SUBDOMAIN` in `projects/app/.env.local` to something like `pinyinly-<yourname>`.
1. In
   [Apple Developer portal](https://developer.apple.com/account/resources/identifiers/list/serviceId)
   edit the Service ID for the app and click **Configure**.
1. Click the + button for **Website URLs**, in the **Return URLs** box add
   `https://<EXPO_TUNNEL_SUBDOMAIN>.ngrok.io/api/auth/login/apple/callback` (replace
   `<EXPO_TUNNEL_SUBDOMAIN>` with the value you chose).
1. Save the changes.
1. Start Expo via `moon run app:dev -- --tunnel`.

## iOS Device Enrolment

Add the iPhone (https://docs.expo.dev/build/internal-distribution/#configure-app-signing):

```sh
npx -y eas-cli device:create
npx -y eas-cli device:rename
```

Add the device to the provisioning profile:

```
npx -y eas-cli build --profile=preview --platform=ios
```

It's important that this is done using the interactive version of the command so that you can
authenticate your Apple Developer account and have it synchronize the provisioning profile.

## Manually marking a Drizzle migration as "run"

In local development it can be useful to merge together migrations without losing local data. In
this case you can manually modify the Drizzle migration state in `drizzle.__drizzle_migrations`.

Copy the timestamp from `_journal.json`, and the hash is the lower-case SHA256 of the `.sql`
migration file.

## Debugging API server running on Vercel

There have been compatibility issues between @expo/server and Vercel in the past. To help debug
these it's useful to run the Vercel server locally in a JavaScript Debug Terminal.

To do this you need build the Expo web output, and then point `app/api/index.cjs` to the output
directory, then run the vercel dev server.

For example you can run something like this:

```sh
cd projects/app
moon run buildVercelExpo --cache=write
```

Now edit `app/api/index.cjs` to point to it:

```diff
-build: require(`path`).join(__dirname, `../dist/vercel/server`),
+build: require(`path`).join(__dirname, `../dist/.cache/vercel-expo/server`),
```

Finally run the vercel dev server: (e.g. with extra logging)

```sh
DEBUG=inngest:* INNGEST_DEV=1 npx vercel dev --listen 8081
```

## Testing Vercel gateway errors locally

Create a `app/api/trpc/replicache.push+api.ts` file containing:

```ts
export function POST() {
  return new Response(
    `An error occurred with your deployment

FUNCTION_INVOCATION_TIMEOUT

syd1::m6bjf-1738011631946-6a41c1b3d99c`,
    {
      status: 504,
      headers: {
        "x-vercel-error": `FUNCTION_INVOCATION_TIMEOUT`,
        "x-vercel-id": `syd1::gqwrj-1738016771255-d9363c982187`,
      },
    },
  );
}
```

Customise this to suit your scenario.

## Environment variables

- **Vercel**: There should be no `EXPO_PUBLIC_` environment variables configured in Vercel's
  environment variables. `EXPO_PUBLIC_` are inlined at build-time by metro so there's no effect from
  having them defined in the environment at runtime too. However other environment variables like
  `DATABASE_URL` **should** be defined here as they are read at run-time.

  **`SENTRY_DSN`**: Needs to be defined here, even though it's typically defined using
  `EXPO_PUBLIC_SENTRY_DSN` in other places, the `Sentry.init()` call is not in code compiled by
  Metro and instead is in the entry-point `projects/app/api/index.cjs`.

- **`EXPO_PUBLIC_`**: These are inlined into the build and exposed publicly. These need to be
  configured anywhere that builds are done:

  - `.github/workflows/release.yml`
  - `.github/workflows/expo-eas-build.yml`
  - `.github/workflows/pr.yml`

  This means they need to be declared in GitHub's Action Secrets too.

  Expo's Metro plugin is patched to error if `PYLY_STRICT_EXPO_ENV_VARS` is set when a
  `EXPO_PUBLIC_` variable is missing. This helps catch errors during build before they reach users.

## Debugging nativewind

First test that tailwind works:

```
yarn tailwindcss --input src/global.css
```

## Updating the bill of materials

The bill of materials is created by looking at what packages were bundled by Metro into client
bundles. Client bundles are actually being distributed, and that's the important point for many OSS
licenses.

Bundling data from Metro is collected from data generated by expo-atlas.

To update the bill of materials run:

```
moon run app:buildBillOfMaterials
```
