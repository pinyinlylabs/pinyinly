- It sets up the listener to expect additional, often more impressive information
- Often paired with words like 而且 (moreover), 还 (also), or 也 (also)
- Creates a sense of escalating importance or impressiveness

- Start with something good, then reveal something even better
- Creates anticipation and maintains listener interest

### **Modesty and Surprise**
- Often used to modestly introduce impressive achievements

- Shows cultural preference for understated revelation of accomplishments

### **Logical Progression**

## Grammar Tips

**Position**: 不仅 usually comes:
- At the beginning of the sentence: 不仅 + first clause
- After the subject: Subject + 不仅 + predicate

**Tone**: Sets up expectation, so the second clause should be stronger or more impressive than the first.

Using 不仅 correctly shows you understand how to **build compelling arguments** and **layer information effectively** in Chinese.
