**🗣️ Pronunciation of 阝 (fù)**

- **Pinyin:** fù
- **Tone: Fourth tone** — sharp **falling** tone, like giving a command

**🔤 Breakdown:**

- **f** like **"f"** in "food"
- **ù** sounds like **"oo"** in "book" but with a sharp falling tone
- **fù** sounds like **"foo"** with a sharp drop

**🎧 Tone tip:**

The **fourth tone** (ˋ) is a **sharp falling** tone:

Start high and drop sharply: **"fù!"** — like the steep slope of a hill.

**📝 Note on Usage:**

阝 is a **radical** that appears in two positions:

**Right side (hill radical):**

- 阳 (yáng) - "sun, positive"
- 阴 (yīn) - "shade, negative"

**Left side (city radical):**

- 都 (dōu) - "all, city"
- 部 (bù) - "part, department"

**📝 Special Notes:**

As a radical, 阝 is rarely pronounced alone. When it appears on the right, it relates to
**hills/geography**. When on the left, it relates to **cities/settlements**.

**💡 Memory Tip:**

Think of a **hill** with a sharp **falling** slope — that's the fourth tone of **fù**!
