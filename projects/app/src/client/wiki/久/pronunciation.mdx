**🗣️ Pronunciation of 久 (jiǔ)**

- **Pinyin:** jiǔ
- **Tone: Third tone** — **falling-rising** tone, like saying "uh-huh" when nodding

**🔤 Breakdown:**

- **j** like **"j"** in "jeep" but softer
- **iǔ** sounds like **"ee-oh"** but with third tone → dip down and rise up
- **jiǔ** sounds like **"jee-oh"** with a dip-then-rise

**🎯 Mastering the "j" sound:**

The **j** in Chinese is softer than English "j":

1. **Start with "j"** like in "jeep"
2. **Make it softer and breathier** — less harsh than English
3. **Keep your tongue relaxed**
4. **Think of it as a gentle "j"**

**🎧 Tone tip:**

The **third tone** (ˇ) is a **fall–then-rise** tone:

Say it like you're stretching out time: **"jiǔ..."** — that long, contemplative dip-then-rise
pattern perfectly matches the meaning of "long time"!

**📝 Common Examples:**

- 久 (jiǔ) - "long time; for a long time"
- 很久 (hěn jiǔ) - "a very long time"
- 好久 (hǎo jiǔ) - "quite a long time"
- 久了 (jiǔ le) - "for a long time now"
- 不久 (bù jiǔ) - "not long; soon"

**💡 Memory Tip:**

The **third tone** perfectly matches **"long time"** — it takes time to dip down and rise up, just
like **jiǔ** stretches out in time!
