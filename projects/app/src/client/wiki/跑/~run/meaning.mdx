| Component | Meaning                                   |

| **包**    | Wrap; package; contain; surround          |

The combination suggests feet wrapped in motion or contained movement energy.

## Mnemonic

Think of 跑 as **"feet wrapped in energetic movement"**:

- The foot radical (足) shows this involves leg and foot action
- 包 (bāo) suggests energy contained and ready to burst forth
- Together: feet that contain and release explosive movement energy
- Picture legs pumping with contained power during running
- Like springs in your feet that propel you forward

This creates the image: **explosive foot energy propelling rapid movement**.
