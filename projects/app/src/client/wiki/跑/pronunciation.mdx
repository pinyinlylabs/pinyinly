**🗣️ Pronunciation of 跑 (pǎo)**

- **Pinyin:** pǎo
- **Tone: Third tone** — **dipping** tone, falls then rises

**🔤 Breakdown:**

- **p** — A strong **aspirated** "p" sound with a puff of air
- **ǎo** sounds like **"ow"** in "cow" but with third tone → dip and rise
- **pǎo** sounds like **"pow"** with a distinctive dip-and-rise pattern

**🎯 Mastering the "p" sound:**

The **p** in Chinese is **aspirated**:

1. **Strong puff of air** — hold hand in front of mouth, should feel air
2. **Crisp and explosive** — like "p" in "pop" or "papa"
3. **More forceful** than English "p" in "spin"

**🎯 Mastering the "ǎo" final:**

The **ǎo** ending combines two sounds:

1. **Start with "a"** like in "father"
2. **Glide to "o"** like in "go"
3. **Make it diphthong** — smooth transition from "a" to "o"
4. **Add third tone** — dip down then rise up

**Common mistakes:**

- ❌ "bow" with English sounds — missing the dipping tone
- ❌ "pao" without aspiration — needs the puff of air
- ❌ Flat tone — must have the characteristic dip-and-rise
- ✅ "pǎo" — aspirated "p" + "ah-oh" + dipping tone

**🎧 Tone tip:**

The **third tone** (ˇ) is a **dipping** tone:

Start **mid, drop low, then rise** — like saying "Oh..." when disappointed then recovering:
**"pǎo!"**

**📝 Practice words:**

- 跑 (pǎo) - "to run"
- 跑步 (pǎo bù) - "to jog; jogging"
- 跑车 (pǎo chē) - "sports car"
- 长跑 (cháng pǎo) - "long-distance running"
- 短跑 (duǎn pǎo) - "sprint"
- 跑道 (pǎo dào) - "track; runway"

**💡 Memory Tip:**

跑 means "to run" — the **dipping tone** is like your energy dipping mid-race then surging back!
Think **"pow!"** with that characteristic Chinese dip-and-rise.
