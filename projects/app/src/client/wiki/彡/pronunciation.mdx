**🗣️ Pronunciation of 彡 (shān)**

- **Pinyin:** shān
- **Tone: First tone** — **high and flat** tone, like a steady note: **"Shaaa"**

**🔤 Breakdown:**

- **sh** like **"sh"** in "shoe"
- **ān** sounds like **"ahn"** but with first tone → steady and high
- **shān** sounds like **"shahn"** with a steady high pitch

**🎧 Tone tip:**

The **first tone** (¯) is a **high flat** tone:

Say it like you're describing flowing hair: **"shān"** — that's the smooth, steady tone of **shān**.

**📝 Common Examples:**

- 彡 (shān) - "hair" (radical form, rarely used alone)
- Used as a component in characters like:
- 形 (xíng) - "shape/form" (contains 彡)
- 影 (yǐng) - "shadow" (contains 彡)
- 彩 (cǎi) - "color" (contains 彡)

**💡 Special Notes:**

彡 is primarily used as a radical component in other characters rather than as a standalone
character. It represents the concept of "hair" or flowing strokes.

**💡 Memory Tip:**

彡 represents "hair" — the smooth first tone flows like **hair** blowing in the wind!
