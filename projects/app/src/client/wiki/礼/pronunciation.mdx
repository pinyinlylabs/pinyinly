**🗣️ Pronunciation of 礼 (lǐ)**

- **Pinyin:** lǐ
- **Tone: Third tone** — **falling-rising** tone, like saying "uh-huh" when nodding

**🔤 Breakdown:**

- **l** like **"l"** in "light"
- **ǐ** sounds like **"ee"** in "see" but with third tone → dip down and rise up
- **lǐ** sounds like **"lee"** with a dip-then-rise

**🎧 Tone tip:**

The **third tone** (ˇ) is a **fall–then-rise** tone:

Say it like you're being respectful and thoughtful: **"lǐ..."** — that's the tone pattern of **lǐ**.

**📝 Common Examples:**

- 礼 (lǐ) - "ceremony; etiquette"
- 礼物 (lǐ wù) - "gift; present"

**💡 Memory Tip:**

**Ceremonies** and **etiquette** require thoughtful, respectful consideration — that contemplative
third tone perfectly matches the respectful nature of **lǐ**!
