- 有 (yǒu) represents having, possessing something
- 的 (de) indicates the specific things being talked about
- 是 (shì) affirms their existence and reality
- Together: emphasizing that not only do these things exist, but there are many of them
- Picture a warehouse full of exactly what you need
- Like saying "don't worry, we have plenty of those"
