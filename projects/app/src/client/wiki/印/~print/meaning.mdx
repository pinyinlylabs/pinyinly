To mark a surface with a design or symbol.

## Mnemonic

印 (print) is like a seal (卩) pressed down to leave a mark. Imagine a hand with three fingers
holding a seal (卩) — together they stamp a print onto paper or clay. The left side is your hand.
The right side (卩) is an official seal. Together: print = hand + seal.
