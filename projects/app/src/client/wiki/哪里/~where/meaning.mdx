## Understanding

Think of 哪里 as **"which place inside"** or **"in what location"**:

- 哪 (nǎ) asks "which one?" among possible choices
- 里 (lǐ) specifies we're talking about a place or location
- Together they form the question "in which place?" = "where?"
- Like asking "which location are we talking about?"

## Usage Examples

- **你在哪里？** (nǐ zài nǎ lǐ?) - "Where are you?"
- **书在哪里？** (shū zài nǎ lǐ?) - "Where is the book?"

- **你从哪里来？** (nǐ cóng nǎ lǐ lái?) - "Where do you come from?"

## Grammar Notes

哪里 is the standard way to ask "where" in Mandarin:

- Often used with 在 (zài) "at/in" to ask about current location
- Can be used with 从 (cóng) "from" to ask about origin
- More formal than 哪儿 (nǎr), which is more colloquial
- Essential question word for directions and location discussions
