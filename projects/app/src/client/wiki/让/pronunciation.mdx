**🗣️ Pronunciation of 让 (ràng)**

- **Pinyin:** ràng
- **Tone: Fourth tone** — **falling** tone, like giving permission: **"Go ahead!"**

**🔤 Breakdown:**

- **r** — This is tricky! **Nothing like** English "r" — it's like "zh" with tongue curled back +
  light vibration
- **àng** sounds like **"ahng"** with falling tone, similar to "wrong" but with Chinese nasal ending
- **ràng** sounds like **"zhahng"** with a slight buzz and falling tone

**🎯 Mastering the Chinese "r" sound:**

The **r** in Chinese is **very different** from English:

1. **Curl your tongue back** — tip pointing toward roof of mouth (like "zh" position)
2. **Add light vibration** — let tongue tip buzz gently against the roof
3. **Keep it soft** — not rolled like Spanish "rr"
4. **Think "zh" + buzz** — start with "zh" sound and add slight vibration

**🎯 Mastering the "àng" final:**

The **àng** ending is **nasalized**:

1. **Start with "ah"** like in "father"
2. **Add "ng"** like at the end of "sing"
3. **Keep tongue back** — "ng" sound comes from back of tongue touching soft palate
4. **Make it resonate** — let the sound echo in your nose and throat

**Common mistakes:**

- ❌ "rang" with English "r" — too harsh and rolled
- ❌ "lang" (using "l" instead) — missing the buzzy quality
- ❌ "rah" (missing the "ng") — needs the nasal ending
- ✅ "ràng" — buzzy "r" + "ah" + nasal "ng" + falling tone

**🎧 Tone tip:**

The **fourth tone** (ˋ) is **authoritative and falling**:

Start **high and drop decisively** — like giving someone permission: **"ràng!"** (Let them!)

**📝 Practice words:**

- 让 (ràng) - "let; allow; make way"
- 让开 (ràng kāi) - "get out of the way"
- 让座 (ràng zuò) - "give up one's seat"
- 不让 (bù ràng) - "not allow; won't let"

**💡 Memory Tip:**

Think of the sound a gentle engine makes — **"zhrrr"** — but softer and with an "ahng" ending. Like
politely clearing your throat before saying "after you!"
