## Mnemonic

Think of 下雨 as **"rain coming down"**:

- 下 shows the downward direction of falling
- 雨 depicts rain itself (you can see the cloud at top and drops below)
- Together: the natural process of rain falling down from sky
- Like nature saying "down comes the rain!"

The combination perfectly captures the physical reality of rain descending from clouds.
