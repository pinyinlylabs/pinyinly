**🗣️ Pronunciation of 已 (yǐ)**

- **Pinyin:** yǐ
- **Tone: Third tone** — **falling-rising** tone, like saying "uh-huh" when nodding

**🔤 Breakdown:**

- **y** like **"y"** in "yes"
- **ǐ** sounds like **"ee"** with third tone → dip down and rise up
- **yǐ** sounds like **"yee"** with a dip-then-rise

**🎧 Tone tip:**

The **third tone** (ˇ) is a **fall–then-rise** tone:

Say it like you're confirming something is done: **"yǐ..."** — that contemplative tone shows
completion.

**📝 Common Examples:**

- 已 (yǐ) - "already; to stop"
- 已经 (yǐ jīng) - "already"
- 早已 (zǎo yǐ) - "long ago; already"
- 业已 (yè yǐ) - "already" (formal)

**💡 Memory Tip:**

Think of **已** as something completed — that **third tone** dip and rise shows the finality of
"already done"!

**📍 Note:**

Don't confuse with similar characters:

- **己** (jǐ) - "oneself"
- **巳** (sì) - "9-11 AM" (different tone)
