什么 is **the basic question word**:

- **什** (miscellaneous things) + **么** (particle)
- Forms the foundation for asking "what"
- Essential component of Chinese questions

### 样 (appearance)

样 depicts **a tree as example or model**:

- **木** (tree) represents the specimen
- **羊** (sheep) shows the example or pattern
- Together: using something as a model to understand characteristics

## Mnemonic
