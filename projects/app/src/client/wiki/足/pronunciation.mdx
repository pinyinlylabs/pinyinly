**🗣️ Pronunciation of 足 (zú)**

- **Pinyin:** zú
- **Tone: Second tone** — **rising** tone, like asking a question

**🔤 Breakdown:**

- **z** — This is an unaspirated **"ts"** sound, like in "cats" but softer
- **ú** sounds like **"oo"** in "zoo" but with second tone → rising upward
- **zú** sounds like a soft **"tsoo"** with a questioning rise

**🎯 Mastering the "z" sound:**

The **z** in Chinese is different from English:

1. **No vibration** — unlike English "z", this is voiceless
2. **Like "ts"** — place tongue tip behind front teeth
3. **Unaspirated** — no puff of air (unlike "ts" in "cats")
4. **Soft and clean** — a gentle "ts" sound

**Common mistakes:**

- ❌ "zoo" with English "z" — too buzzy and voiced
- ❌ "tsu" with heavy aspiration — should be gentler
- ✅ "zú" — soft "ts" + "oo" + rising tone

**🎧 Tone tip:**

The **second tone** (´) is a **rising** tone:

Start **low and rise steadily** — like asking "foot?" with curiosity: **"zú?"**

**📝 Practice words:**

- 足够 (zú gòu) - "enough; sufficient"
