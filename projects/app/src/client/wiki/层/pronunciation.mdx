**🗣️ Pronunciation of 层 (céng)**

- **Pinyin:** céng
- **Tone: Second tone** — **rising** tone, like asking "What level?"

**🔤 Breakdown:**

- **c** like **"ts"** in "cats" — a sharp "ts" sound at the beginning
- **éng** sounds like **"ung"** with rising tone, similar to the ending of "sung"
- **céng** sounds like **"tsung"** with a questioning rise

**🎯 Mastering the Chinese "c" sound:**

The **c** in Chinese is **very different** from English:

1. **Not like "c" in "cat"** — it's more like "ts"
2. **Sharp and crisp** — like the "ts" at the end of "cats"
3. **Unaspirated** — no puff of air like English "ch"
4. **Think "tsunami"** — but just the "ts" part

**🎯 Mastering the "éng" final:**

The **éng** ending is **nasalized**:

1. **Start with "uh"** — like in "huh"
2. **Add "ng"** — like at the end of "sing"
3. **Back of tongue touches soft palate** — creates the "ng" sound
4. **Let it resonate** — nasal quality

**Common mistakes:**

- ❌ "seng" (using "s" instead of "ts") — too soft
- ❌ "cheng" (using "ch") — too aspirated
- ❌ "tsay" (missing the nasal "ng") — needs the back-of-tongue closure
- ✅ "céng" — sharp "ts" + nasal "eng" + rising tone

**🎧 Tone tip:**

The **second tone** (ˊ) is **rising like a question**:

Start **low and rise up** — like asking "Which floor?" when looking at building levels.

**📝 Common Examples:**

- 层 (céng) - "layer; floor; level"
- 楼层 (lóu céng) - "floor (of a building)"
- 层次 (céng cì) - "level; hierarchy"
- 一层 (yī céng) - "first floor"

**💡 Memory Tip:**

Think of counting floors in a building with a questioning tone: "Which 层?" — the rising tone
suggests looking up at different levels!
