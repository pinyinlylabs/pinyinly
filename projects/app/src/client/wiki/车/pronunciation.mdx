**🗣️ Pronunciation of 车 (chē)**

- **Pinyin:** chē
- **Tone: First tone** — **high level** tone, steady and flat

**🔤 Breakdown:**

- **ch** — An aspirated "ch" sound with tongue curled back (retroflex)
- **ē** — A pure "e" sound like "ay" in "day" but without the glide
- **chē** — Like "chay" with retroflex tongue position and high flat tone

**🎯 Mastering the "ch" sound:**

The **ch** in Chinese is **retroflex and aspirated**:

1. **Curl tongue back** — tip pointing toward roof of mouth
2. **Strong aspiration** — puff of air like English "ch" in "chair"
3. **Retroflex position** — similar to "zh" but with air flow
4. **More hollow** than English "ch" — tongue creates space underneath
5. **Hold position** — don't let tongue slip forward

**🎯 Mastering the "ē" vowel:**

The **ē** sound is a **mid-front vowel**:

1. **Pure sound** — like "ay" in "day" but hold the first part
2. **No glide** — don't move to "ee" sound
3. **Mouth position** — halfway between "eh" and "ay"
4. **Steady vowel** — maintain consistent sound throughout
5. **Clear and crisp** — well-defined vowel sound

**Common mistakes:**

- ❌ English "ch" — tongue too forward, not retroflex
- ❌ "chee" sound — wrong vowel, should be "ay" not "ee"
- ❌ Adding glide — should be pure "e", not "ay-ee"
- ✅ "chē" — retroflex aspirated "ch" + pure "e" + high flat tone

**🎧 Tone tip:**

The **first tone** (¯) is **high and level**:

Keep it **steady at high pitch** — like announcing clearly: **"chē!"** (Car!)
