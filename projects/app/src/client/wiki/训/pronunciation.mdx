**🗣️ Pronunciation of 训 (xùn)**

- **Pinyin:** xùn
- **Tone: Fourth tone** — **falling** tone, like giving instruction: **"Listen up!"**

**🔤 Breakdown:**

- **x** — Like a soft "sh" sound, made with tongue tip down (not curled back)
- **ùn** sounds like **"oon"** in "moon", but with fourth tone falling sharply
- **xùn** sounds like **"shoon"** with authoritative falling tone

**🎯 Mastering the "x" sound:**

Chinese **x** is different from English:

1. **Tongue tip DOWN** — touching lower teeth (opposite of "sh")
2. **Tongue body UP** — middle of tongue raised toward roof of mouth
3. **Soft airflow** — like whispering "she" but with tongue tip down
4. **Not retroflex** — no curling of tongue tip

**🎯 Mastering the "ùn" final:**

The **ùn** combines vowel + nasal:

1. **Start with "oo"** — rounded lips, like in "moon"
2. **Add "n"** — tongue tip to upper teeth
3. **Keep lips rounded** — throughout the whole sound
4. **Fourth tone** — start high, fall sharply

**Common mistakes:**

- ❌ "shun" with English "sh" — tongue tip should be down, not curled
- ❌ "sun" with "s" sound — missing the soft, whispered quality
- ❌ "hun" with "h" — needs the proper tongue position for "x"
- ✅ "xùn" — soft whispered sound + rounded vowel + nasal + falling tone

**🎧 Tone tip:**

The **fourth tone** (ˋ) is **commanding and authoritative**:

Start **high and drop decisively** — like a teacher getting students' attention: **"xùn!"**

**📝 Practice words:**

- 训 (xùn) - "teach; train; instruction"
- 训练 (xùn liàn) - "train; practice"
- 培训 (péi xùn) - "training course"
- 教训 (jiào xùn) - "lesson; moral"

**💡 Memory Tip:**

Think of a whispered but firm instruction — **"xùn"** — like a coach quietly but decisively
directing training.
