**🗣️ Pronunciation of 举 (jǔ)**

- **Pinyin:** jǔ
- **Tone: Third tone** — **falling-rising** tone, like saying "uh-huh" when nodding

**🔤 Breakdown:**

- **j** like **"j"** in "jeep" but softer
- **ǔ** sounds like **"oo"** in "book" but with third tone → dip down and rise up
- **jǔ** sounds like **"joo"** with a dip-then-rise

**🎯 Mastering the "j" sound:**

The **j** in Chinese is softer than English "j":

1. **Start with "j"** like in "jeep"
2. **Make it softer and breathier** — less harsh than English
3. **Keep your tongue relaxed**
4. **Think of it as a gentle "j"**

**🎧 Tone tip:**

The **third tone** (ˇ) is a **fall–then-rise** tone:

Say it like you're lifting something thoughtfully: **"jǔ..."** — that deliberate dip-then-rise
motion.

**📝 Common Examples:**

- 举 (jǔ) - "to lift; to raise; to hold up"
- 举手 (jǔ shǒu) - "to raise one's hand"
- 举办 (jǔ bàn) - "to organize; to hold (an event)"
- 举行 (jǔ xíng) - "to hold; to conduct"
- 选举 (xuǎn jǔ) - "election"

**💡 Memory Tip:**

Think of **lifting** something up — the third tone **jǔ** mimics the motion of raising something
with effort, dipping down first then rising up!
