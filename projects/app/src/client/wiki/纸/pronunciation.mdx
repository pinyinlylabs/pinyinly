**🗣️ Pronunciation of 纸 (zhǐ)**

- **Pinyin:** zhǐ
- **Tone: Third tone** — **falling-rising** tone, like saying "uh-huh" when nodding

**🔤 Breakdown:**

- **zh** like **"j"** in "judge" (but with tongue curled back)
- **ǐ** sounds like **"ee"** in "see", but with third tone → dip down and rise up
- **zhǐ** sounds like **"jee"** (with curled tongue) with a dip-then-rise

**🎧 Tone tip:**

The **third tone** (ˇ) is a **fall–then-rise** tone:

Say it like you're thoughtfully examining paper: **"zhǐ..."** — that's the tone pattern of **zhǐ**.

**📝 Common Examples:**

- 纸 (zhǐ) - "paper"
- 报纸 (bào zhǐ) - "newspaper"
- 纸张 (zhǐ zhāng) - "sheet of paper"
- 白纸 (bái zhǐ) - "white paper"

**💡 Memory Tip:**

When you're carefully handling **paper**, you're thoughtful and gentle — just like the contemplative
dip-and-rise of the third tone in **zhǐ**!
