**🗣️ Pronunciation of 讨 (tǎo)**

- **Pinyin:** tǎo
- **Tone: Third tone** — **falling-rising** tone, like expressing curiosity: **"Let's discuss..."**

**🔤 Breakdown:**

- **t** like **"t"** in "top", but with a slight puff of air (aspirated)
- **ǎo** sounds like **"ow"** in "cow", but with third tone → dip down and rise up
- **tǎo** sounds like **"tow"** with a thoughtful dip-then-rise

**🎯 Mastering the "t" sound:**

Chinese **t** is **aspirated** (with a puff of air):

1. **Place tongue tip** behind upper teeth (like English "t")
2. **Release with air** — hold a tissue in front of your mouth; it should flutter
3. **Make it crisp** — clear, sharp release
4. **Practice** — "tah" with strong puff of air

**🎯 Mastering the "ǎo" final:**

The **ǎo** diphthong has two parts:

1. **Start with "ah"** — open mouth, tongue low
2. **Glide to "oh"** — lips round slightly, like in "go"
3. **Third tone curve** — start mid, dip down, then rise up
4. **Smooth transition** — don't pause between "ah" and "oh"

**🎧 Tone tip:**

The **third tone** (ˇ) is a **fall–then-rise** tone:

Say it like you're pondering something: **"tǎo..."** — that thoughtful, questioning quality is
perfect for "discuss."

**📝 Practice words:**

- 讨 (tǎo) - "discuss; talk about"
- 讨论 (tǎo lùn) - "discuss; debate"
- 讨厌 (tǎo yàn) - "dislike; find annoying"
- 讨价 (tǎo jià) - "bargain; negotiate price"

**💡 Memory Tip:**

Think of the sound "tao" like in Taoism — that contemplative, philosophical quality captures the
third tone perfectly for "discuss."
