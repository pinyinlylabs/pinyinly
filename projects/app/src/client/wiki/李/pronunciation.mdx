**🗣️ Pronunciation of 李 (lǐ)**

- **Pinyin:** lǐ
- **Tone: Third tone** — **falling-rising** tone, like saying "uh-huh" when nodding

**🔤 Breakdown:**

- **l** like **"l"** in "love"
- **ǐ** sounds like **"ee"** in "see", but with third tone → dip down and rise up
- **lǐ** sounds like **"lee"** with a dip-then-rise

**🎧 Tone tip:**

The **third tone** (ˇ) is a **fall–then-rise** tone:

Say it like you're thoughtfully savoring something: **"lǐ..."** — that contemplative dip and rise is
the third tone pattern.

**📝 Common Examples:**

- 李 (lǐ) - "plum; surname Li"
- 李子 (lǐ zi) - "plum (fruit)"
- 李树 (lǐ shù) - "plum tree"
- 李先生 (lǐ xiān sheng) - "Mr. Li"
- 李小姐 (lǐ xiǎo jiě) - "Miss Li"

**💡 Memory Tip:**

Think of **李** as thoughtfully tasting a sweet "plum" — the contemplative third tone matches the
careful appreciation of the fruit's flavor!
