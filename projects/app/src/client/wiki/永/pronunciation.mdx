**🗣️ Pronunciation of 永 (yǒng)**

- **Pinyin:** yǒng
- **Tone: Third tone** — **falling-rising** tone, like saying "uh-huh" when nodding

**🔤 Breakdown:**

- **y** like **"y"** in "yes"
- **ǒng** sounds like **"ong"** in "wrong" but with third tone → dip down and rise up
- **yǒng** sounds like **"young"** with a dip-then-rise

**🎯 Mastering the "ong" final:**

The **ong** ending is a **nasal final** with a back vowel:

1. **Start with "o"** like in "or" (but shorter)
2. **Add the "ng"** sound like at the end of "song"
3. **Keep the vowel round** — lips slightly rounded
4. **Let the "ng" resonate** in the back of your mouth

**Common mistakes:**

- ❌ "yong" with flat tone — needs the falling-rising tone
- ❌ "young" like English — the vowel should be more "oh" than "uh"
- ❌ Missing the "ng" nasal sound — should end with a clear "ng"
- ✅ "yǒng" — "y" + round "oh" + "ng" + third tone dip-rise

**🎧 Tone tip:**

The **third tone** (ˇ) is **fall–then-rise**:

Start **mid-low, dip down, then rise up** — like being thoughtful: **"yǒng..."**

**📝 Practice words:**

- 永远 (yǒng yuǎn) - "forever"
- 永久 (yǒng jiǔ) - "permanent"
- 永不 (yǒng bù) - "never"

**💡 Memory Tip:**

Think of something that lasts **"young"** forever — but say it with that thoughtful, falling-rising
tone like you're contemplating eternity!
