## Mnemonic

Think of 天 as **a person standing under the infinite sky**:

- The horizontal line (一) at the top represents the vast expanse of sky
- The character 大 below shows a person with arms stretched wide
- Like someone standing in an open field, looking up at the endless sky
- The person appears small beneath the immensity of heaven

This captures the ancient Chinese concept of humans as part of the cosmic order, standing beneath the dome of heaven.
