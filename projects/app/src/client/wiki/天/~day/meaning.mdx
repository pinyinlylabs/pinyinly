## Mnemonic

Think of 天 as **measuring time by the sky's cycle**:

- The horizontal line (一) represents the boundary between earth and sky
- The person (大) below experiences the passage of time under this sky
- During the day, we can see the sun crossing this sky boundary
- The full cycle of light and darkness creates one "天" (day)

The character connects the cosmic rhythm of day and night with human experience, showing how we
measure time by observing the sky above us.
