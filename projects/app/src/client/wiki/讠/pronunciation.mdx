**🎧 Tone tip:**

The **second tone** (´) is a **rising** tone:

Say it like you're about to speak: **"yán?"** — that upward rise shows the anticipation of speech.

**📝 Special Note:**

讠 is the **radical form** of 言 (speech). It appears as a component on the left side of many
characters related to speaking, talking, or language. When used independently, it has the same
pronunciation as 言.

**📝 Common Examples in Characters:**

- 说 (shuō) - "speak" (with 讠 radical)
- 话 (huà) - "words; speech" (with 讠 radical)
- 语 (yǔ) - "language" (with 讠 radical)
- 词 (cí) - "word" (with 讠 radical)

**💡 Memory Tip:**

Think of 讠 as the "speech radical" — it's the streamlined form of 言 that helps create words about
communication, maintaining the same rising tone that suggests speaking up!
