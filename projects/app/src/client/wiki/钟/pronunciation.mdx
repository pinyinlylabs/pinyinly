**🗣️ Pronunciation of 钟 (zhōng)**

- **Tone: First tone** — **high and flat** tone, like a steady note

**🔤 Breakdown:**

- **zh** like **"j"** in "judge" but with tongue curled back
- **ōng** sounds like **"ong"** in "song", but held steady and high
- **zhōng** sounds like **"jong"** with a steady high pitch

**🎧 Tone tip:**

The **first tone** (ˉ) is a **high flat** tone:

Keep your voice high and steady throughout: **"zhōng"** — like the steady ringing of a bell.

**📝 Special Notes:**

The character 钟 contains the metal radical 钅, which makes sense since bells and clocks are
typically made of metal.
