**🗣️ Pronunciation of 辆 (liàng)**

- **Pinyin:** liàng
- **Tone: Fourth tone** — **falling** tone, sharp and decisive

**🔤 Breakdown:**

- **l** — A clear "l" sound with tongue tip touching roof of mouth
- **i** — A short "ee" sound like in "see"
- **àng** — Sounds like "ahng" with fourth tone → sharp fall
- **liàng** — Like "lee-ahng" with clear "l" and falling tone

**🎯 Mastering the "l" sound:**

The **l** in Chinese is similar to English:

1. **Tongue tip up** — press firmly against roof of mouth behind front teeth
2. **Clear contact** — make sure tongue tip makes solid connection
3. **Lateral airflow** — air flows around sides of tongue
4. **Clean release** — smoothly transition into the vowel
5. **Consistent position** — maintain tongue contact throughout

**🎯 Mastering the "iàng" combination:**

This involves **vowel sequence plus nasal**:

1. **Start with "i"** — short "ee" sound, tongue high and forward
2. **Glide to "a"** — open mouth wide, tongue drops
3. **Add "ng"** — back of tongue touches soft palate
4. **Nasal resonance** — sound echoes in nose and throat
5. **Make it smooth** — flow from "ee" to "ah" to nasal "ng"
6. **Add fourth tone** — whole sequence falls sharply

**Common mistakes:**

- ❌ Weak "l" contact — needs firm tongue-to-roof connection
- ❌ "lee-ang" separated — should flow as one syllable
- ❌ Missing nasal quality — needs strong "ng" resonance
- ❌ Wrong tone — must fall decisively from high to low
- ✅ "liàng" — clear "l" + smooth "i-a-ng" + falling tone

**🎧 Tone tip:**

The **fourth tone** (ˋ) is **falling and definitive**:

Start **high and drop sharply** — like counting vehicles decisively: **"liàng!"**
