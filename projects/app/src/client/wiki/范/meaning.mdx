| Component | Meaning                                              |
| --------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| **竹**    | Bamboo radical (⺮) - structured, organized material |
| **氾**    | Spread, overflow - suggesting scope and boundaries   |

The combination suggests "bamboo framework that defines boundaries" or a structured model.

## Mnemonic

Think of 范 as **"a bamboo framework that sets the pattern and boundaries"**:

- ⺮ (bamboo) represents organized structure, like bamboo scaffolding
- 氾 suggests the scope or area that's defined by this structure
- Together: a framework that defines how things should be done
- Picture bamboo scaffolding that shows builders how to construct properly
- Like a template or pattern that guides people in the right direction
- The framework that shows the proper scope and method

This creates the image: **a structured framework that defines proper boundaries and methods**.

## Core Meaning & Usage

1. **Model/example**: 模范 (mófàn) - "model; exemplary"
2. **Scope/range**: 范围 (fànwéi) - "scope; range; limits"
3. **Pattern**: 范式 (fànshì) - "paradigm; pattern"
4. **Standards**: 规范 (guīfàn) - "standard; norm; specification"

## Cultural Context

范 reflects the Chinese cultural emphasis on following proper models and maintaining appropriate
scope. In Confucian tradition, having good 范 (models) to follow is essential for moral development
and social harmony. The concept emphasizes both the importance of exemplary behavior and the need to
operate within proper boundaries and standards.
