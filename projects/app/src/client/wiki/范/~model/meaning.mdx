| **竹**    | Bamboo radical (⺮) - structured, organized material       |
| **氾**    | Spread, overflow - suggesting scope and boundaries       |

The combination suggests "bamboo framework that defines boundaries" or a structured model.

## Mnemonic

Think of 范 as **"a bamboo framework that sets the pattern and boundaries"**:

- ⺮ (bamboo) represents organized structure, like bamboo scaffolding
- 氾 suggests the scope or area that's defined by this structure
- Together: a framework that defines how things should be done
- Picture bamboo scaffolding that shows builders how to construct properly
- Like a template or pattern that guides people in the right direction
- The framework that shows the proper scope and method

This creates the image: **a structured framework that defines proper boundaries and methods**.
