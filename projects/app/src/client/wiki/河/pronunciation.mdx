**🗣️ Pronunciation of 河 (hé)**

- **Pinyin:** hé
- **Tone: Second tone** — **rising** tone, like asking a question: **"Really?"**

**🔤 Breakdown:**

- **h** like **"h"** in "hat" (breathy sound)
- **é** sounds like **"eh"** in "bed" with rising tone
- **hé** sounds like **"heh?"** with a questioning rise

**🎯 Mastering the "e" final:**

The **e** sound in Chinese is different from English:

1. **More open than "eh"** in "bed" — jaw more relaxed
2. **Less closed than "ay"** in "day" — don't glide to "ee"
3. **Think "uh" but more forward** — tongue slightly forward
4. **Keep it pure** — don't add extra vowel sounds

**Common mistakes:**

- ❌ "hay" with English "ay" sound — should be more like "eh"
- ❌ "huh" sound — should be more forward, not back in throat
- ❌ Flat tone — needs the rising, questioning tone
- ❌ Too closed like "hee" — should be more open
- ✅ "hé" — breathy "h" + open "eh" + rising tone

**🎧 Tone tip:**

The **second tone** (ˊ) is **rising and questioning**:

Start **low and rise up** — like asking **"River?"** or expressing surprise: **"hé?"**

**📝 Practice words:**

- 河流 (hé liú) - "river; stream"
- 河水 (hé shuǐ) - "river water"
- 黄河 (huáng hé) - "Yellow River"
- 长江 (cháng jiāng) - "Yangtze River" (note: different word for major rivers)

**💡 Memory Tip:**

Think of asking **"Heh?"** when you discover a river — that questioning, rising tone shows surprise
at finding flowing water, just like the flowing sound of the word!
