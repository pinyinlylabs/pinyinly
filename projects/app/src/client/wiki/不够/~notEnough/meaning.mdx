## Mnemonic

Think of 不够 as **"can't reach enough"**:

- 够 represents reaching far enough to get what you need
- 不 blocks or prevents this reaching
- Together: unable to reach the necessary amount = "not enough"
- Like stretching your hand but not being able to grab enough items

The concept captures the frustration of falling short or lacking sufficiency.
