| **系**    | Tie/connect - represents binding, linking, or systematic connections      |

## Mnemonic

Think of 关系 as **closing the gap to create a connection**:

- 关 (close/shut) + 系 (tie/connect) = "closing distance to tie together"
- Like shutting the space between two things to create a bond
- Bringing separate entities close enough to form lasting connections
- The act of "closing" distance and "tying" relationships together

This creates the meaning: **the bonds and connections that link people or things**.
