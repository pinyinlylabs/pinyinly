| Component | Meaning                                                       |

| **固**    | Historical evolution - the character has simplified over time |

## Understanding

Think of 个 as the **"piece" or "unit" counter**:

- Like saying "one piece of..." or "one unit of..." in English
- It's the default counter when you're unsure which specific measure word to use
- Almost any noun can be counted with 个 in everyday conversation
- It emphasizes the individual nature of what you're counting

## Usage Examples

### **People**

- **一个人** (yī gè rén) - "one person"
- **三个学生** (sān gè xuéshēng) - "three students"

### **Objects**

- **两个苹果** (liǎng gè píngguǒ) - "two apples"
- **一个问题** (yī gè wèntí) - "one question"

### **Abstract Concepts**

- **一个想法** (yī gè xiǎngfǎ) - "one idea"
- **两个小时** (liǎng gè xiǎoshí) - "two hours"

## Grammar Notes

个 is used in the pattern: **Number + 个 + Noun**

- **这个** (zhè gè) - "this one"
- **那个** (nà gè) - "that one"
- **哪个** (nǎ gè) - "which one?"
- **几个** (jǐ gè) - "how many?" / "several"

## Cultural Context

个 reflects the Chinese emphasis on **specificity and precision** in language:

- **Measure words show respect** for the nature of what you're counting
- **个 is the safe choice** - when in doubt, use 个 and you'll be understood
- **It's uniquely Chinese** - this grammatical feature doesn't exist in English
- **Shows individuality** - each thing is counted as a distinct unit

Using 个 correctly is a key step in developing **natural-sounding Chinese**.
