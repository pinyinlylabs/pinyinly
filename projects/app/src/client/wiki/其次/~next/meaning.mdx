## Mnemonic

Think of 其次 as **"designating the next sequence"**:

- 其 (qí) represents pointing to a specific designated position
- 次 (cì) represents order, sequence, and the second position
- Together: pointing to the next item in a designated sequence
- Picture organizing ideas in numbered order and pointing to number two
- Like following a logical sequence and reaching the second point
- The structured progression from first to second in reasoning

This creates the image: **pointing to the designated second position in a logical sequence**.
