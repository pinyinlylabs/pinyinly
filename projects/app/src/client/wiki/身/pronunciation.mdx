**🗣️ Pronunciation of 身 (shēn)**

- **Pinyin:** shēn
- **Tone: First tone** — **high level** tone, steady and flat

**🔤 Breakdown:**

- **sh** — A "sh" sound with tongue curled back (retroflex)
- **ēn** — Sounds like "en" in "pen" but with first tone → high and steady
- **shēn** — Like "shen" with tongue curled back and high flat tone

**🎯 Mastering the "sh" sound:**

The **sh** in Chinese is **retroflex**:

1. **Curl tongue back** — tip pointing toward roof of mouth
2. **Not like English "sh"** — tongue position is different
3. **More hollow sound** — creates space under tongue
4. **Practice "zh" first** — then add air flow for "sh"
5. **Keep it steady** — don't let tongue slip forward

**🎯 Mastering the "ēn" final:**

The **ēn** ending is **nasalized**:

1. **Start with "e"** — like "e" in "her" (schwa sound)
2. **Add nasal "n"** — tongue tip touches roof of mouth
3. **Nasal resonance** — sound echoes in nose
4. **Keep it crisp** — don't drag it out

**Common mistakes:**

- ❌ English "sh" — tongue too forward, not retroflex enough
- ❌ "shin" sound — wrong vowel, should be more central
- ❌ Not maintaining tone — must stay high and level
- ✅ "shēn" — retroflex "sh" + nasal "en" + steady high tone

**🎧 Tone tip:**

The **first tone** (¯) is **high and level**:

Keep it **steady at high pitch** — like a confident declaration: **"shēn!"**

**📝 Practice words:**

- 身 (shēn) - "body; self"
- 身体 (shēn tǐ) - "body; health"
- 身份 (shēn fèn) - "identity; status"
- 身边 (shēn biān) - "beside; nearby"
- 身上 (shēn shang) - "on the body"
- 全身 (quán shēn) - "whole body"
- 身高 (shēn gāo) - "height (of person)"

**💡 Memory Tip:**

身 means "body" — the **steady high tone** represents the solid, constant presence of your body!
