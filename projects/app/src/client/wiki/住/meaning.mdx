## Character Analysis

### 住 (zhù)

The character 住 shows a **person (亻)** next to **master (主)**. This suggests someone who has
authority or control over a place - essentially, someone who lives there and calls it home.

The 主 component originally depicted a lamp or torch standing upright, symbolizing something that
stands firm and central - like a master of a household.

## Mnemonic

Think of 住 as a **person (亻)** who is the **master (主)** of their own home. When you live
somewhere, you become the master of that space.

## Cultural Context

In Chinese culture, where one lives (住) is closely tied to family, stability, and social status.
The concept of 住 encompasses not just physical dwelling but also belonging to a community and
establishing roots.

Traditional Chinese architecture emphasized the 住 concept through courtyard houses (四合院) where
multiple generations would 住 together, reinforcing family bonds and hierarchy.
