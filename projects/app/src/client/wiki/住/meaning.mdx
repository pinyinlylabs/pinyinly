## Cultural Context

In Chinese culture, where one lives (住) is closely tied to family, stability, and social status.
The concept of 住 encompasses not just physical dwelling but also belonging to a community and
establishing roots.

Traditional Chinese architecture emphasized the 住 concept through courtyard houses (四合院) where
multiple generations would 住 together, reinforcing family bonds and hierarchy.
