## Visual Breakdown

咖啡 is a **phonetic transliteration** of the English word "coffee."

| Component | Meaning                                                      |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **咖**    | Phonetic character (kā) - mouth radical 口 + 加 (to add)    |
| **啡**    | Phonetic character (fēi) - mouth radical 口 + 非 (not/non-) |

Both characters use the mouth radical (口) indicating this is something consumed orally, with the remaining components providing the phonetic sounds kā-fēi.

## Mnemonic

Think of 咖啡 as **"mouth sounds for coffee"**:

- Both 咖 and 啡 have the mouth radical (口) showing it's something you drink
- 咖 (kā) sounds like the "ca" in "café" 
- 啡 (fēi) sounds like "fee" - completing "coffee"
- The combination creates the sound that Chinese speakers use to say "coffee"
- Picture someone saying "kā-fēi" while drinking from a coffee cup

This creates the image: **using your mouth to say and drink coffee**.
