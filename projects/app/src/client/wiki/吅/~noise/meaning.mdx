- Picture people talking simultaneously, creating a din or clamor
- Like a crowded marketplace where everyone is talking
- The overlapping voices that create background noise
- Multiple conversations happening at the same time

This creates the image: **the cacophony that results when multiple people speak simultaneously**.

## Cultural Context

吅 reflects the Chinese understanding of collective voice and community expression. In Chinese

potential chaos when too many voices speak without coordination. It represents the balance between
individual expression and harmonious communication.
