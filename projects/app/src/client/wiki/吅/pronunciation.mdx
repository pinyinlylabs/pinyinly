**🗣️ Pronunciation of 吅 (xuān)**

- **Pinyin:** xuān
- **Tone: First tone** — **high and flat** tone, like a steady note: **"Eeee"**

**🔤 Breakdown:**

- **x** — This is tricky! It's like **"sh"** in "she" but **breathier** and **sharper**
- **uān** sounds like **"wan"** in "want" but held steady and high
- **xuān** sounds like a breathy **"shwan"** with steady high pitch

**🎯 Mastering the "x" sound:**

The **x** in Chinese is **not** like English "x" (ks). Instead:

1. **Start with "sh"** like in "she"
2. **Add more breath** — make it airier and sharper
3. **Keep your tongue tip down** — don't let it touch the roof of your mouth

Think **"she"** but with a sharp breath of air!

**🎧 Tone tip:**

The **first tone** (¯) is **steady and high**:

Say it like you're announcing something loudly — that's the energy of **xuān**.

**📝 Common Examples:**

- 吅闹 (xuān nào) - "noisy, clamorous"
- 吅哗 (xuān huá) - "clamor, uproar"
- 吅嚣 (xuān xiāo) - "clamorous"
