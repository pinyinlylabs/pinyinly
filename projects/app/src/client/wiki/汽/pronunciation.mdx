**🗣️ Pronunciation of 汽 (qì)**

- **Pinyin:** qì
- **Tone: Fourth tone** — sharp **falling** tone, like giving a command: **"qì!"**

**🔤 Breakdown:**

- **q** like **"ch"** in "cheese" but with more air (aspirated)
- **ì** sounds like **"ee"** in "see" with sharp falling tone
- **qì** sounds like **"chee!"** with a sharp drop

**🎯 Mastering the "q" initial:**

The **q** sound is an **aspirated unvoiced consonant**:

1. **Start like "ch"** in "cheese"
2. **Add strong puff of air** — hold your hand in front of your mouth, you should feel air
3. **Keep tongue position high** — tip touches lower teeth, middle arches up
4. **Make it crisp and sharp** — not soft

**Common mistakes:**

- ❌ "chee" without aspiration — needs the strong puff of air
- ❌ "kee" sound — should be "ch" position, not "k"
- ❌ Weak falling tone — should be sharp and decisive
- ❌ Rising tone — should fall sharply, not rise
- ✅ "qì" — aspirated "ch" + high "ee" + sharp fall

**🎧 Tone tip:**

The **fourth tone** (ˋ) is **sharp and falling**:

Start **high and drop sharply** — like giving a firm command: **"qì!"**

**📝 Practice words:**

- 汽车 (qì chē) - "car; automobile"
- 汽水 (qì shuǐ) - "soda; soft drink"
- 汽油 (qì yóu) - "gasoline"
- 蒸汽 (zhēng qì) - "steam; vapor"

**💡 Memory Tip:**

Think of steam shooting out with a sharp **"chee!"** sound — like a pressure cooker releasing steam
with that decisive, falling tone. The "q" puffs air just like steam!
