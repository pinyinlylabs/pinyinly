**🗣️ Pronunciation of 岁 (suì)**

- **Pinyin:** suì
- **Tone: Fourth tone** — **falling** tone, like stating your age: **"I'm 25!"**

**🔤 Breakdown:**

- **s** like **"s"** in "see"
- **uì** sounds like **"way"** but with sharp falling tone
- **suì** sounds like **"sway"** with a decisive drop

**🎯 Mastering the "uì" final:**

The **uì** ending is a **diphthong** (two sounds blended):

1. **Start with "oo"** — like in "soon"
2. **Quickly glide to "ay"** — like in "way"
3. **Blend them smoothly** — don't pause between sounds
4. **Add falling tone** throughout the glide

**Common mistakes:**

- ❌ "soo" (missing the "ay" part) — needs the "oo-ay" glide
- ❌ "say" (missing the "oo" start) — should begin with "oo"
- ❌ "su-ee" (two separate syllables) — should be one smooth glide
- ✅ "suì" — smooth "oo-ay" glide with falling tone

**🎧 Tone tip:**

The **fourth tone** (ˋ) is **decisive and falling**:

Start **high and drop sharply** — like confidently stating a fact: **"I'm 20 suì!"** (years old)

**📝 Common Examples:**

- 岁 (suì) - "years old; year of age"
- 几岁 (jǐ suì) - "how old; how many years old"
- 二十岁 (èr shí suì) - "20 years old"
- 岁数 (suì shu) - "age"
- 周岁 (zhōu suì) - "full year of age"

**💡 Memory Tip:**

The falling tone sounds like confidently stating your age — decisive and clear: **"I'm 25 suì!"**
The gliding sound mimics the passage of time flowing by.
