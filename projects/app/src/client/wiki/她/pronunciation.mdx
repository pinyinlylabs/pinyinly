**🗣️ Pronunciation of 她 (tā)**

- **Pinyin:** tā
- **Tone: First tone** — **high and flat** tone, like a steady note

**🔤 Breakdown:**

- **t** like **"t"** in "top"
- **ā** sounds like **"ah"**, but with first tone → high and steady
- **tā** sounds like **"tah"** with a high, flat pitch

**🎧 Tone tip:**

The **first tone** (¯) is a **high and flat** tone:

Say it clearly and steadily: **"tā..."** — that's the even, high pitch of the **first tone**.

**📝 Common Examples:**

- 她 (tā) - "she, her"
- 她们 (tā men) - "they (female)"
- 她的 (tā de) - "her, hers"
- 她是 (tā shì) - "she is"
- 她说 (tā shuō) - "she says"
- 她们的 (tā men de) - "their (female)"

**💡 Special Notes:**

她 is the feminine third-person pronoun "she/her." It was created in the early 20th century to
distinguish from the general pronoun 他 (he/him). The character uses the "woman" radical (女)
combined with 也, making the gender distinction clear in written Chinese.

**📍 Gender Distinction:**

- 他 (tā) - he/him (masculine/neutral)
- 她 (tā) - she/her (feminine)
- 它 (tā) - it (for objects/animals)

All are pronounced identically but written differently.
