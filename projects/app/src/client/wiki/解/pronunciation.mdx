**🗣️ Pronunciation of 解 (jiě)**

- **Pinyin:** jiě
- **Tone: Third tone** — **falling-rising** tone, like saying "uh-huh" when nodding

**🔤 Breakdown:**

- **j** like **"j"** in "jeep" but softer
- **i** like **"ee"** in "see"
- **ě** sounds like **"eh"** but with third tone → dip down and rise up
- **jiě** sounds like **"jee-eh"** with a dip-then-rise

**🎧 Tone tip:**

The **third tone** (ˇ) is a **fall–then-rise** tone:

Say it like you're working through a problem: **"jiě..."** — that thoughtful processing pattern.

**📝 Common Examples:**

- 解 (jiě) - "solve; divide; untie"
- 解决 (jiě jué) - "solve; resolve"
- 解开 (jiě kāi) - "untie; undo"
- 理解 (lǐ jiě) - "understand"
- 解释 (jiě shì) - "explain"

**💡 Memory Tip:**

Think of 解 as "solving" or "untying" something complex — you work through it thoughtfully with that
back-and-forth mental process, just like the third tone's dip-and-rise!
