**🗣️ Pronunciation of 没 (méi)**

- **Pinyin:** méi
- **Tone: Second tone** — **rising** tone, like asking a question: **"Really?"**

**🔤 Breakdown:**

- **m** exactly like English **"m"** in "me"
- **éi** sounds like **"ay"** in "way" but with rising tone
- **méi** sounds like **"may?"** with a questioning rise

**🎯 Mastering the "éi" final:**

The **éi** ending is a **diphthong** (two sounds blended):

1. **Start with "eh"** like in "bed" (but shorter)
2. **Glide quickly to "ee"** like in "see"
3. **Blend smoothly** — don't pause between the sounds
4. **Keep it short and crisp** — not drawn out like English "way"

**Common mistakes:**

- ❌ "may" with flat tone — needs the rising tone
- ❌ "mee" (just one sound) — needs to start with "eh" and glide to "ee"
- ❌ "may" drawn out like English — should be quick and crisp
- ✅ "méi" — quick "m" + "eh-ee" glide + rising tone

**🎧 Tone tip:**

The **second tone** (ˊ) is **rising and questioning**:

Start **low and rise up** — like asking "Oh really?" or expressing surprise: **"méi?"**

**📝 Practice words:**

- 没有 (méi yǒu) - "don't have; there isn't"
- 没关系 (méi guān xi) - "doesn't matter; no problem"
- 没事 (méi shì) - "it's okay; nothing's wrong"
- 没问题 (méi wèn tí) - "no problem"

**💡 Memory Tip:**

Think of someone asking **"May I?"** with a questioning tone — but say it quickly and crisply. The
rising tone suggests you're checking if something exists or happened!
