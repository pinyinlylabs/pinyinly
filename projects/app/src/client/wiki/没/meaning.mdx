## Grammar Notes

没 is the primary negation for past actions and possession:

- Used specifically to negate 有 (yǒu) "to have": 没有 (méi yǒu)
- Used for past actions that didn't happen: 没 + verb
- Different from 不 (bù) which negates present/future states
- Essential for expressing what someone doesn't have or didn't do
- Critical for understanding Chinese tense and aspect

## Cultural Context

没 represents the concept of absence and non-occurrence, essential for accurate communication about
what exists, what doesn't exist, and what didn't happen.
