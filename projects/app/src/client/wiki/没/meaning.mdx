## Visual Breakdown

没 combines **water + gone** to show disappearance or absence.

| Component | Visual Description                                          |
| --------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| **氵**    | Water radical (氵) - indicates flowing or disappearing      |
| **殳**    | Gone/disappeared (殳) - suggests something that was removed |

## Mnemonic

Think of 没 as **"water that has flowed away" or "what was there is now gone"**:

- The water radical (氵) represents something that flows and disappears
- The disappearance component (殳) shows absence or non-existence
- Like water that evaporated or flowed away - it's no longer there
- Shows the absence of something that might have been expected to be present

## Usage Examples

- **没有** (méi yǒu) - "don't have; there isn't; no"
- **没关系** (méi guān xi) - "it doesn't matter; no problem"
- **没事** (méi shì) - "it's okay; no problem; nothing's wrong"
- **我没去** (wǒ méi qù) - "I didn't go"

## Grammar Notes

没 is the primary negation for past actions and possession:

- Used specifically to negate 有 (yǒu) "to have": 没有 (méi yǒu)
- Used for past actions that didn't happen: 没 + verb
- Different from 不 (bù) which negates present/future states
- Essential for expressing what someone doesn't have or didn't do
- Critical for understanding Chinese tense and aspect

## Cultural Context

没 represents the concept of absence and non-occurrence, essential for accurate communication about
what exists, what doesn't exist, and what didn't happen.
