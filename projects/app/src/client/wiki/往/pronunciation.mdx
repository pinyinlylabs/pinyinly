**🗣️ Pronunciation of 往 (wǎng)**

- **Pinyin:** wǎng
- **Tone: Third tone** — **falling-rising** tone, like saying "uh-huh" when nodding

**🔤 Breakdown:**

- **w** like **"w"** in "way"
- **ǎng** sounds like **"ahng"** but with third tone → dip down and rise up
- **wǎng** sounds like **"wahng"** with a dip-then-rise

**🎧 Tone tip:**

The **third tone** (ˇ) is a **fall–then-rise** tone:

Say it like you're thoughtfully deciding which direction to go: **"wǎng..."** — that's the
contemplative tone pattern of **wǎng**.

**📝 Common Examples:**

- 往 (wǎng) - "toward; to go to"
- 往往 (wǎng wǎng) - "often; frequently"
- 前往 (qián wǎng) - "to go to; to head for"
- 交往 (jiāo wǎng) - "to associate with; interaction"

**💡 Memory Tip:**

Think of **"wahng"** with a thoughtful dip-rise — when deciding which direction to go **toward**,
you often pause and think contemplatively, just like the third tone's pattern!
