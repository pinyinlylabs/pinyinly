- You grip the handle at the bend for leverage and control
- When you see 丂 in a character, think "tool", "handle", or "angular shape"
- It's like seeing the outline of a handle you would hold while working

This radical connects characters to concepts of **tools, holding, and angular shapes**.

## Core Meaning & Usage

丂 appears as a **component in characters related to tools and angular forms**:

1. **Tools and implements**: Characters involving farming tools, weapons, or instruments
2. **Angular shapes**: Characters describing bends, corners, or L-shaped forms
3. **Holding/gripping**: Characters involving grasping or manipulating objects
4. **Structural elements**: Characters describing architectural or structural components

## Examples in Characters

- **考** (kǎo) - "to test/examine" (丂 + 老) - like using a tool to probe or examine
- **巧** (qiǎo) - "skillful/clever" (丂 + 工) - skillful use of tools and craft

## Cultural Context

In ancient Chinese culture, **agricultural tools** were fundamental to civilization:

- **Tools represented human ingenuity** and the ability to shape the environment
- **Handles provided leverage** - a key principle in both physical work and metaphorical strength
- **Angular shapes** in tools showed purposeful design rather than natural curves
- **Craftsmanship** was highly valued, connecting tools to skill and intelligence

The 丂 radical preserves this connection between **tools, skill, and purposeful design** in written
Chinese.
