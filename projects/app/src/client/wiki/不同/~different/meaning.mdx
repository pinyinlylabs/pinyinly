## Mnemonic

Think of 不同 as **"not sharing the same mouth/space"**:

- 同 shows things coming together in the same space (口)
- 不 blocks or cancels this togetherness
- Together: things that don't come together = "different"
- Like people who can't share the same view or opinion

The concept is literally "not same" - when things don't match or align.
