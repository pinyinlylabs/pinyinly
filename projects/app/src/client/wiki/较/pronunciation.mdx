**🗣️ Pronunciation of 较 (jiào)**

- **Pinyin:** jiào
- **Tone: Fourth tone** — **falling** tone, sharp and decisive

**🔤 Breakdown:**

- **j** — An unaspirated "j" sound, palatal position
- **i** — A short "ee" sound like in "see"
- **ào** — Sounds like "ow" in "cow" with fourth tone → sharp fall
- **jiào** — Like "jee-ow" compressed together with falling tone

**🎯 Mastering the "j" sound:**

The **j** in Chinese is **unaspirated and palatal**:

1. **No puff of air** — unlike "q", this has no aspiration
2. **Palatal position** — middle of tongue touches hard palate
3. **Like soft "ch"** — similar to "j" in "jeep" but more forward
4. **Tongue tip down** — behind lower teeth, not curled back
5. **Clean contact** — firm but gentle tongue-to-palate contact

**🎯 Mastering the "iào" combination:**

This is a **triphthong** (three vowel sounds):

1. **Start with "i"** — short "ee" sound, tongue high and forward
2. **Glide to "a"** — open mouth, tongue drops
3. **End with "o"** — round lips for "oh" sound
4. **Make it smooth** — all three sounds flow together quickly
5. **Add fourth tone** — whole combination falls sharply

**Common mistakes:**

- ❌ Adding aspiration — "j" should be gentle, not explosive
- ❌ Using retroflex position — should be palatal, not retroflex
- ❌ Separating "jee-ah-oh" — should flow as one smooth sound
- ❌ Wrong tone — must fall decisively from high to low
- ✅ "jiào" — unaspirated "j" + smooth "i-a-o" + falling tone

**🎧 Tone tip:**

The **fourth tone** (ˋ) is **falling and definitive**:

Start **high and drop sharply** — like making a comparison decisively: **"jiào!"** (Compare!)

**💡 Memory Tip:**

较 means "to compare" — the **sharp falling tone** is like definitively pointing out a difference!
