### 什 (what)

什 depicts **a person with various things**:

- **亻** (person radical) represents the person asking
- **十** (ten) suggests multiple possibilities or items
- Together: a person wondering about various things
- Used mainly in compound question words

## Mnemonic

Think of 什 as **"a person surrounded by ten different things wondering 'what?'"**:

- Picture someone looking at a collection of items, puzzled
- The "ten" suggests many possibilities to choose from
- Like standing in a store with many options, asking "what should I get?"

## Grammar Patterns

什 typically:

- **In questions**: 这是什么？ - "What is this?"
- **With particles**: 什么的 - "and so on"

## Cultural Context

- **Grammatical foundation**: Part of the core question word system
