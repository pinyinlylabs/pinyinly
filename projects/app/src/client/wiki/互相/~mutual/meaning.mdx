| **互**    | Mutual, reciprocal - represents back-and-forth exchange     |
| **相**    | Each other, mutual - from eye (目) + tree (木) = looking at |

The combination emphasizes "reciprocal looking at each other" or "mutual back-and-forth action."

## Mnemonic

Think of 互相 as **"back-and-forth looking at each other"**:

- 互 (hù) shows crossing lines - like arrows going both directions
- 相 (xiāng) means looking at each other face-to-face
- Together: people facing each other and exchanging equally
- Picture two people having a conversation, each listening and responding
- The characters suggest balance - what goes one way comes back the other
- Remember: "互 = interactive, 相 = seeing each other"

This creates the image: **balanced two-way interaction between equals**.

## Cultural Context

互相 embodies the Confucian ideal of reciprocity (报) and social harmony. It reflects the Chinese
cultural emphasis on balanced relationships where giving and receiving are equal. This concept is
fundamental to Chinese social interactions, from family relationships to business partnerships. The
principle of 互相 suggests that healthy relationships require both parties to contribute equally,
avoiding the imbalance that leads to conflict. It's closely related to the golden rule concept but
emphasizes the ongoing, dynamic nature of mutual exchange rather than one-time actions.
