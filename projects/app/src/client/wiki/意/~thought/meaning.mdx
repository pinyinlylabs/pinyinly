## Mnemonic

Think of 意 as **"the heart's voice seeking to express itself"**:

- 音 (sound) represents the expression, communication, or voice
- 心 (heart) represents the inner thoughts, feelings, and intentions
- Together: the inner thoughts and feelings that want to be expressed
- Picture your heart trying to communicate its deepest thoughts
- Like the moment when inner feelings find their voice
- The bridge between what you feel inside and what you want to say

This creates the image: **inner thoughts and feelings finding their voice and seeking expression**.
