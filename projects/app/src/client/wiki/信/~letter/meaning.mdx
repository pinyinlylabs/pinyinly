## Visual Breakdown

信 combines **person + words** to show written communication.

| Component | Visual Description                                     |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| **亻**    | Person radical (人) - indicates this relates to people |
| **言**    | Speech/words (言) - represents written communication   |

## Mnemonic

Think of 信 as **a person's words put in writing**:

- The person radical (亻) shows this is about human communication
- The speech component (言) represents the written words or message
- When someone puts their thoughts into written form to send to another
- Like capturing spoken words on paper to deliver across distance

This same character means both "believe" and "letter" because letters were traditionally trusted
forms of communication - they carried the authentic words of the sender.

## Usage Examples

- **写信** (xiě xìn) - "write a letter"
- **收到信** (shōu dào xìn) - "receive a letter"
- **信件** (xìn jiàn) - "correspondence; mail"
- **回信** (huí xìn) - "reply to a letter"

## Cultural Context

信 as "letter" reflects traditional Chinese communication:

- Letters were formal and respectful forms of communication
- Connected to the concept of trust (same character for "believe")
- Important for maintaining relationships across distances
- Now extends to modern forms like email and messages
