| Component | Meaning                                         |
| --------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| **昨**    | Yesterday, previous day - contains 日 (sun/day) |
| **天**    | Day, sky, heaven - represents time period       |

昨 (zuó) itself breaks down as:

- **日** (rì) - sun, day, representing the concept of a day
- **乍** (zhà) - sudden, abrupt, suggesting something recent/immediate

## Mnemonic

Think of 昨天 as **"the day that just passed away"**:

- 昨 (zuó) contains 日 (sun) - the sun that already set
- 天 (tiān) means day/heaven - the day that's now in the past
- Together: the day when the sun was shining that's now behind us
- Picture looking back at yesterday's sunset that's now just a memory

This creates the image: **the day that the sun already finished shining on**.
