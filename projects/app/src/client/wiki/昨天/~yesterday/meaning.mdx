## Mnemonic

Think of 昨天 as **"the day when the sun already finished shining"**:

- 昨 (zuó) contains 日 (sun) - representing a day that's completed its cycle
- 天 (tiān) shows the full day period that has passed
- Together: the complete day that has already ended
- Like looking back at yesterday's sunset that's now just a memory
- The day that was present but is now in the immediate past

This creates the image: **the completed day that has just moved into the past**.
