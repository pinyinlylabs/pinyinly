些 reflects Chinese quantification concepts:

- **Modesty**: Using 些 shows humility about quantities (not claiming too much)
- **Vagueness**: Chinese allows for intentional vagueness in quantities
- **Politeness**: 一些 is often more polite than exact numbers
- **Flexibility**: 些 allows speakers to be non-committal about specific amounts
- **Practical communication**: Useful when exact quantities aren't important or known
