**🗣️ Pronunciation of 中 (zhōng)**

- **Pinyin:** zhōng
- **Tone: First tone** — **high and flat** tone, like a steady note: **"Eeee"**

**🔤 Breakdown:**

- **zh** — This is like **"j"** in "jump" but with the tongue curled back slightly
- **ōng** sounds like **"ong"** in "song" but held steady and high
- **zhōng** sounds like a steady **"jong"** with high pitch

**🎯 Mastering the "zh" sound:**

The **zh** in Chinese is **not** like English "z". Instead:

1. **Start with "j"** like in "jump"
2. **Curl your tongue tip back** slightly toward the roof of your mouth
3. **Keep it soft** — not as harsh as English "j"
4. **Think of it as a "retroflex j"**

**🎧 Tone tip:**

The **first tone** (¯) is **high and flat**:

Keep your voice **steady and high** throughout — like humming a single high note: **"zhōōōng"**

**📝 Common Examples:**

- 中 (zhōng) - "middle; center"
- 中国 (zhōng guó) - "China"
- 中文 (zhōng wén) - "Chinese language"
- 中午 (zhōng wǔ) - "noon"
- 中心 (zhōng xīn) - "center"

**💡 Memory Tip:**

Think of 中 as the **center** — steady and balanced like the **first tone**, right in the **middle**
of all the other tones!
