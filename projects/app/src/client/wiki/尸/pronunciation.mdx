**🗣️ Pronunciation of 尸 (shī)**

- **Pinyin:** shī
- **Tone: First tone** — **high and flat** tone, like a steady whistle: **"Sheee"**

**🔤 Breakdown:**

- **sh** like **"sh"** in "she" but with tongue tip curled back slightly
- **ī** sounds like **"ee"** in "see" but held steady and high
- **shī** sounds like **"she"** with a steady high pitch

**🎯 Mastering the Chinese "sh" sound:**

The **sh** in Chinese is **slightly different** from English:

1. **Start with English "sh"** — like in "shoe"
2. **Curl tongue back slightly** — tip pointing toward roof of mouth
3. **Make it a bit deeper** — more resonant than English "sh"
4. **Keep it soft** — not harsh or hissing

**🎧 Tone tip:**

The **first tone** (ˉ) is **high and steady**:

Stay **high and flat** throughout — like humming a single note. No rising or falling, just maintain
the high pitch.

**📝 Common Examples:**

- 尸 (shī) - "corpse; body" (mostly used as a radical in other characters)
- 尸体 (shī tǐ) - "corpse; dead body"

**📚 Note on Usage:**

尸 is primarily used as a radical (部首) in Chinese characters rather than as a standalone word in
modern Chinese. It appears in characters like:

- 居 (jū) - "live; reside"
- 屋 (wū) - "house"
- 展 (zhǎn) - "open; display"

**💡 Memory Tip:**

The high, flat tone sounds like a steady, solemn tone — appropriate for the serious meaning of this
character.
