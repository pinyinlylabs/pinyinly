## Mnemonic

Think of 划船 as **"cutting through the water with your boat"**:

- 划 (huá) represents the cutting motion of oars slicing through water
- 船 (chuán) represents the boat that moves through the water
- Together: using oars to cut through water and propel your boat
- Picture the rhythmic motion of oars slicing into the water
- Like the smooth strokes that push the boat forward through water
- The satisfying feeling of paddling and gliding across a lake
