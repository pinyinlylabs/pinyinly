- **fú** sounds like **"foo?"** with an upward rise

**🎧 Tone tip:**

The **second tone** (´) is a **rising** tone:

Start low and rise up high, like asking "What should I wear?" when thinking about clothes.

**📚 Special Notes:**

In 衣服 (yī fu), the second 服 is pronounced with neutral tone (fu) rather than second tone, making
it easier to say.

服 means "clothes" or "serve" - when asking about clothing or offering service, you naturally use
that helpful, questioning tone: **"fú?"** (what can I help you with?)
