**🗣️ Pronunciation of 汤 (tāng)**

- **Pinyin:** tāng
- **Tone: First tone** — **high and flat** tone, like a steady note: **"taaaang"**

**🔤 Breakdown:**

- **t** like **"t"** in "top" (unaspirated, crisp)
- **āng** sounds like **"ahng"** with steady high tone
- **tāng** sounds like **"tahng"** with a steady high pitch

**🎯 Mastering the "ang" final:**

The **ang** ending is a **nasal final** with a back vowel:

1. **Start with "ah"** like in "father"
2. **Add the "ng"** sound like at the end of "song"
3. **Keep the vowel open and back** — tongue low, mouth open
4. **Let the "ng" resonate** in the back of your mouth

**Common mistakes:**

- ❌ "tang" like English — the "a" should be more open, like "ah"
- ❌ "tong" sound — should be "ah" not "oh"
- ❌ Missing the "ng" nasal sound — should end with clear "ng"
- ❌ Rising or falling tone — should stay high and flat
- ✅ "tāng" — crisp "t" + open "ah" + resonant "ng" + high steady tone

**🎧 Tone tip:**

The **first tone** (¯) is **high and steady**:

Start **high and stay level** — like singing a steady note: **"tāāāng"**

**📝 Practice words:**

- 汤圆 (tāng yuán) - "sweet dumplings in soup"
- 鸡汤 (jī tāng) - "chicken soup"
- 菜汤 (cài tāng) - "vegetable soup"
- 汤匙 (tāng chí) - "soup spoon"

**💡 Memory Tip:**

Think of savoring a delicious **"tahn"** (soup) and holding that satisfied **"ahhhh"** sound steady
and high — like you're appreciating the flavor!
