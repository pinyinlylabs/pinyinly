## Visual Breakdown

小 shows **something small and divided**, representing smallness and youth.

| Component       | Visual Description                            |
| --------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| **丨** (middle) | Vertical stroke                               |
| **八** (sides)  | Two small diagonal strokes spreading downward |

## Mnemonic

Think of 小 as **something small that divides into even smaller parts**:

- A narrow object (丨) splitting at the bottom into tiny pieces (八)
- Like a small stick or plant stem with small branches
- A person shrinking down with legs getting smaller
- Raindrops (the vertical line) breaking apart as they fall

The character visually suggests division and diminishing size, opposite to 大 which spreads outward
to show bigness.

## Learning Notes

小 is essential because:

- Fundamental adjective for size, age, and importance
- Perfect complement to learning 大

The pairing of 大 and 小 demonstrates the Chinese principle of complementary opposites (yin-yang
thinking)!
