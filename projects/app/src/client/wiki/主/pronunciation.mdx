**🗣️ Pronunciation of 主 (zhǔ)**

- **Pinyin:** zhǔ
- **Tone: Third tone** — **falling-rising** tone, like saying "uh-huh" when nodding

**🔤 Breakdown:**

- **zh** — This is like **"j"** in "jump" but with the tongue curled back slightly
- **ǔ** sounds like **"oo"** in "book" but with third tone → dip down and rise up
- **zhǔ** sounds like **"joo"** with a dip-then-rise

**🎯 Mastering the "zh" sound:**

The **zh** in Chinese is **not** like English "z". Instead:

1. **Start with "j"** like in "jump"
2. **Curl your tongue tip back** slightly toward the roof of your mouth
3. **Keep it soft** — not as harsh as English "j"

**🎧 Tone tip:**

The **third tone** (ˇ) is a **fall–then-rise** tone:

Say it like you're thinking or being thoughtful: **"zhǔ..."** — that contemplative dip-then-rise
pattern.

**📝 Common Examples:**

- 主 (zhǔ) - "master; main; primary"
- 主人 (zhǔ rén) - "master; host"
- 主要 (zhǔ yào) - "main; primary"
- 主动 (zhǔ dòng) - "active; initiative"
- 主意 (zhǔ yi) - "idea; plan"

**💡 Memory Tip:**

Think of a **master** or **leader** — someone who speaks with authority but thoughtfully, using that
deliberate dip-and-rise **zhǔ** tone!
