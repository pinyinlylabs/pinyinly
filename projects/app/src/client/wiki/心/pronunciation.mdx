**🗣️ Pronunciation of 心 (xīn)**

- **Pinyin:** xīn
- **Tone: First tone** — **high and flat** tone, like a steady note: **"Sheen"**

**🔤 Breakdown:**

- **x** — This is tricky! It's like **"sh"** in "she" but **breathier** and **sharper**
- **īn** sounds like **"een"** in "seen" but held steady and high
- **xīn** sounds like **"sheen"** with a steady high pitch

**🎯 Mastering the "x" sound:**

The **x** in Chinese is **not** like English "x" (ks). Instead:

1. **Start with "sh"** like in "she"
2. **Add more breath** — make it airier and sharper
3. **Keep your tongue tip down** — don't let it touch the roof of your mouth

**🎧 Tone tip:**

The **first tone** (¯) is a **high and flat** tone:

Say it like you're holding a steady note about the **heart**: **"xīn..."** — that's the tone pattern
of **xīn**.

**📝 Common Examples:**

- 心 (xīn) - "heart; mind"
- 心情 (xīn qíng) - "mood; state of mind"
- 心里 (xīn lǐ) - "in one's heart/mind"
- 小心 (xiǎo xīn) - "be careful"
- 开心 (kāi xīn) - "happy; cheerful"
- 关心 (guān xīn) - "to care about"

**💡 Memory Tip:**

Think of **"sheen"** with a steady high tone — the **heart** has a steady, constant beat, just like
the first tone's pattern!
