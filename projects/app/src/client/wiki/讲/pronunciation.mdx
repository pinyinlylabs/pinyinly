**🗣️ Pronunciation of 讲 (jiǎng)**

- **Pinyin:** jiǎng
- **Tone: Third tone** — **falling-rising** tone, like engaging in conversation: **"Let me tell
  you..."**

**🔤 Breakdown:**

- **j** — Like soft "j" in "jeep", made with tongue tip down
- **iǎng** sounds like **"ee-ahng"** with third tone dip-and-rise
- **jiǎng** sounds like **"jee-ahng"** with thoughtful fall-then-rise

**🎯 Mastering the "j" sound:**

Chinese **j** is softer than English:

1. **Tongue tip DOWN** — touching lower teeth
2. **Tongue body raised** — middle of tongue up toward roof
3. **Soft and clean** — like gentle "j" in "jeep"
4. **Quick release** — don't linger on the consonant

**🎯 Mastering the "iǎng" final:**

The **iǎng** is a complex final with three parts:

1. **Start with "ee"** — high front vowel, tongue up
2. **Glide to "ah"** — tongue drops, mouth opens
3. **End with "ng"** — back of tongue touches soft palate
4. **Third tone curve** — dip down in the middle, then rise

**🎧 Tone tip:**

The **third tone** (ˇ) is **conversational and engaging**:

Like starting to tell a story: **"jiǎng..."** — that thoughtful, engaging quality perfect for
"talk/speak."

**Common mistakes:**

- ❌ English "j" with hard attack — should be soft
- ❌ Skipping the "i" glide — it's "jee-ahng", not "jahng"
- ❌ Missing the "ng" — needs that nasal ending
- ❌ Wrong tone curve — must dip then rise
- ✅ "jiǎng" — soft "j" + "ee" + "ah" + nasal "ng" + third tone

**📝 Practice words:**

- 讲 (jiǎng) - "talk; speak; tell"
- 讲话 (jiǎng huà) - "speak; give a speech"
- 讲课 (jiǎng kè) - "give a lecture"

**💡 Memory Tip:**

Think of starting to tell an engaging story — **"jiǎng..."** — with that conversational, inviting
tone that draws people in to listen.
