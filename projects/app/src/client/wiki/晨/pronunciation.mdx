**🗣️ Pronunciation of 晨 (chén)**

- **Pinyin:** chén
- **Tone: Second tone** — **rising** tone, like asking a question

**🔤 Breakdown:**

- **ch** like **"ch"** in "chair" (but with tongue curled back)

- **chén** sounds like **"chen?"** with a questioning rise

**🎯 Mastering the "ch" sound:**

The **ch** in Chinese is different from English "ch":

1. **Curl your tongue back** — tip pointing toward the roof of your mouth
2. **More breath** — make it aspirated (you should feel air on your hand)
3. **It's closer to "chr"** than plain "ch"
