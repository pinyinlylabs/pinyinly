**🗣️ Pronunciation of 矢 (shǐ)**

- **Pinyin:** shǐ
- **Tone: Third tone** — **falling-rising** tone, like saying "uh-huh" when nodding

**🔤 Breakdown:**

- **sh** like **"sh"** in "she"
- **ǐ** sounds like **"ee"** in "see" but with third tone → dip down and rise up
- **shǐ** sounds like **"shee"** with a dip-then-rise

**🎧 Tone tip:**

The **third tone** (ˇ) is a **fall–then-rise** tone:

Say it like you're aiming carefully: **"shǐ..."** — that contemplative tone pattern of **shǐ**.

**📝 Common Examples:**

- 矢 (shǐ) - "arrow"
- 矢量 (shǐ liàng) - "vector" (mathematics/physics)
- 有的放矢 (yǒu dì fàng shǐ) - "shoot with a definite target in mind"

**💡 Memory Tip:**

Think of **"shee"** with a contemplative dip-then-rise — when aiming an **arrow**, you carefully
focus and then release with that thoughtful motion!

**📝 Note:**

矢 is more commonly used in formal or literary contexts. In everyday speech, 箭 (jiàn) is more
commonly used for "arrow".
