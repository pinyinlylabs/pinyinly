- The "also/other" component (也) indicates someone different from the speaker
- Like saying "that other person also" or "another man too"
- Shows acknowledgment of a male person who is separate from the conversation

## Cultural Context

他 is essential for referring to males in Chinese:

- Part of the fundamental pronoun system (我, 你, 他)
- Used for both known and unknown male persons
- Contrasts with 她 (tā) for females, which sounds identical but uses different characters
- Important for storytelling, descriptions, and social interactions
- Foundation for understanding Chinese grammar and social relationships
