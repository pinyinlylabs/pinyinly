**🗣️ Pronunciation of 只 (zhǐ)**

- **Pinyin:** zhǐ
- **Tone: Third tone** — **falling-rising** tone, like saying "uh-huh" when nodding

**🔤 Breakdown:**

- **zh** like **"j"** in "judge" (with tongue curled back)
- **ǐ** sounds like **"ee"** in "see" but with third tone → dip down and rise up
- **zhǐ** sounds like **"jee"** with a dip-then-rise

**🎧 Tone tip:**

The **third tone** (ˇ) is a **fall–then-rise** tone:

Say it like you're emphasizing "only this": **"zhǐ..."** — that's the contemplative tone pattern of
**zhǐ**.

**📝 Common Examples:**

- 只 (zhǐ) - "only; just"
- 只是 (zhǐ shì) - "only; just; merely"
- 只有 (zhǐ yǒu) - "only have; only"
- 只要 (zhǐ yào) - "as long as; provided that"
- 只好 (zhǐ hǎo) - "have no choice but to"

**💡 Memory Tip:**

Think of **"jee"** with a contemplative rise — when saying **"only"**, you often pause thoughtfully,
just like the third tone's pattern!
