**🗣️ Pronunciation of 口 (kǒu)**

- **Pinyin:** kǒu
- **Tone: Third tone** — **falling-rising** tone, like saying "uh-huh" when nodding

**🔤 Breakdown:**

- **k** like **"k"** in "key"
- **ǒu** sounds like **"oh"** but with third tone → dip down and rise up
- **kǒu** sounds like **"ko"** with a dip-then-rise

**🎧 Tone tip:**

The **third tone** (ˇ) is a **fall–then-rise** tone:

Say it like you're thinking or being thoughtful: **"kǒu..."** — that's the contemplative tone
pattern of **kǒu**.

**📝 Common Examples:**

- 口 (kǒu) - "mouth; opening"
- 人口 (rén kǒu) - "population"
- 入口 (rù kǒu) - "entrance"
- 出口 (chū kǒu) - "exit; export"
- 开口 (kāi kǒu) - "open one's mouth; speak"

**💡 Memory Tip:**

The character 口 looks like an open **mouth** — and when you say **kǒu** with the third tone, your
mouth naturally forms that contemplative "uh-huh" shape!
