## Character Analysis: 缺

缺 shows **a broken vessel**:
- **缶** (vessel/container) represents something that should hold things
- **决** (decisive/breach) shows a break or gap in the container
- Together: a container with a hole - unable to hold what it should

## Mnemonic

Think of 缺少 as **a leaky bucket with too little water**:

- 缺 (lacking) is like a bucket with holes - it can't retain what goes in
- 少 (little) shows the water level is too low
- You need more water, but the container can't hold enough
- This represents any situation where what you have falls short of what you need
