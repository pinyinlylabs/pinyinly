## Mnemonic

Think of 看 as **using your hand to shield your eyes while looking**:

- The hand component (手) shows the gesture of putting your hand to your forehead
- The eye component (目) represents focused visual attention
- Like a sailor looking out to sea, shading their eyes with their hand
- Or someone peering into the distance with hand over eyes
- Shows **deliberate, focused observation**

This creates the image: **actively directing your vision toward something specific**.
