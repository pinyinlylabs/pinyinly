**🎯 Mastering the "w" sound:**

The **w** is straightforward - exactly like English:

2. **Quickly transition** to the following vowel
3. **Same as English "w"** in "way" or "we"

The **ei** diphthong is consistent, only the tone changes:

1. **Start with "eh"** like in "bed" (but shorter)
2. **Glide to "ee"** like in "see"
3. **Blend smoothly** — one fluid sound
4. **Apply the correct tone** throughout the glide

**🎧 Tone comparison:**
