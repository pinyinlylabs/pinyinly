| **今**    | Originally depicted "now" as a covering (𠆢) over present (卩) |

The ancient form showed something being covered or contained in the present moment, emphasizing the
immediacy and containment of "now."

## Mnemonic

Think of 今 as **"this very moment captured"**:

- The top part (人) looks like a person pointing downward
- The bottom part (卩) represents kneeling or being present
- Together: someone pointing to "right here, right now"
- Picture yourself saying "this moment" while pointing down
- The present instant that contains your entire experience
- The only time when action and awareness can happen

This creates the image: **the immediate present moment you are experiencing**.

## Cultural Context

今 emphasizes the importance of present-moment awareness in Chinese philosophy. Buddhism and Daoism
both stress living in the present, and 今 captures this temporal focus. The concept connects to the
Chinese value of seizing current opportunities rather than dwelling on the past or worrying about
the future. In traditional Chinese medicine, 今 represents the critical importance of addressing
health issues in the present moment, reflecting the belief that timely action prevents future
problems.
