**🗣️ Pronunciation of 隹 (zhuī)**

- **Pinyin:** zhuī
- **Tone: First tone** — **high and flat** tone, like a steady note

**🔤 Breakdown:**

- **zh** like **"j"** in "judge" but with tongue curled back
- **uī** sounds like **"way"** but held steady and high
- **zhuī** sounds like **"jway"** with a steady high pitch

**🎧 Tone tip:**

The **first tone** (ˉ) is a **high and flat** tone:

Say it like a bird's steady call from high up: **"zhuī..."** — that consistent, high tone.

**📝 Common Examples:**

- 隹 (zhuī) - "short-tailed bird" (radical)
- 谁 (shéi/shuí) - "who" (contains 隹 radical)
- 雀 (què) - "sparrow" (contains 隹 radical)

**Special Note:**

隹 is primarily used as a **radical** in other characters rather than as a standalone word. It
represents the concept of "bird" and appears in many bird-related characters.

**💡 Memory Tip:**

Think of a bird perched high and steady - that consistent first tone matches the steady presence of
**隹** as the "short-tailed bird" radical!
