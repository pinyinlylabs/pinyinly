### 事实 (facts)

- **事** (affairs) shows concrete occurrences
- **实** (real) emphasizes genuine truth
- Together: undeniable factual information

### 上 (on/above)

上 shows **something positioned above**:

- Creates an adverbial meaning "in terms of" or "regarding"
- Transforms 事实 from noun to adverbial phrase
- Shows perspective or point of reference

## Mnemonic

Think of 事实上 as **"standing on the solid ground of facts"**:

- 事实 (facts) is the solid foundation of truth
- 上 (on) means you're standing on that foundation when speaking
- Like saying "based on the facts" before revealing truth
- Used when reality differs from what was assumed
