**🗣️ Pronunciation of 彳 (chì)**

- **Pinyin:** chì
- **Tone: Fourth tone** — sharp **falling** tone, like giving a command: **"Chir!"**

**🔤 Breakdown:**

- **ch** like **"ch"** in "church" but with tongue curled back
- **ì** sounds like **"ir"** in "sir" but shorter and with fourth tone → sharp fall
- **chì** sounds like **"chir!"** with a sharp drop

**🎧 Tone tip:**

The **fourth tone** (ˋ) is a **sharp falling** tone:

Say it like you're commanding someone to **step**: **"chì!"** — that's the decisive tone pattern of
**chì**.

**📝 Common Examples:**

- 彳 (chì) - "step; walk slowly" (radical meaning)

**💡 Special Note:**

彳 is primarily used as a **radical** (called the "step" radical) in Chinese characters related to
walking, moving, or going. It appears in characters like:

- 行 (xíng) - "to walk; to go"
- 往 (wǎng) - "toward; to go"
- 待 (dài) - "to wait"

As a standalone character, 彳 is rarely used in modern Chinese, but knowing its pronunciation helps
understand the phonetic components in compound characters.

**💡 Memory Tip:**

Think of **"chir!"** with a sharp fall — like giving a firm command to **step** forward!
