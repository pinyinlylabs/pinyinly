**🗣️ Pronunciation of 了**

了 has **two different pronunciations** depending on its usage:

**📍 le (neutral tone) - particle indicating completion/change**

- **Pinyin:** le (neutral tone)
- **Tone: Neutral tone** — **light and quick**, like the final syllable in "simple"

**🔤 Breakdown:**

- **l** like **"l"** in "like"
- **e** sounds like **"uh"** but very light and quick
- **le** sounds like a quick **"luh"** at the end of sentences

**📍 liǎo (third tone) - "to finish, to understand"**

- **Pinyin:** liǎo
- **Tone: Third tone** — **falling-rising** tone, like saying "uh-huh" when nodding

**🔤 Breakdown:**

- **l** like **"l"** in "like"
- **iǎo** sounds like **"ee-ow"** but with the third tone → dip down and rise up
- **liǎo** sounds like **"lee-ow"** with a dip-then-rise

**🎧 Tone tip:**

**le** (neutral) = light, quick, unstressed — just a grammatical marker **liǎo** (third tone) = full
tone with dip-then-rise — a real verb meaning
