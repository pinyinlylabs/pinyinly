## Grammar Notes

不对 can function as:

1. **Predicate**: 这个不对 ("This is wrong")
2. **Complement**: 说得不对 ("said incorrectly")
3. **Interjection**: 不对！("Wrong!" "No!")

**Common patterns:**
- **不对劲** - "something's not right" (more serious)

- **不对头** - "not right" (colloquial, suspicious)

不对 is **essential vocabulary** for error correction and expressing disagreement in Chinese.
