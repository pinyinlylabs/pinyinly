## Visual Breakdown

害 combines concepts of roof/shelter and mouth, suggesting harm to what should be protected.

| Component | Meaning                                               |
| --------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| **宀**    | Roof radical - representing shelter, protection, home |
| **口**    | Mouth - representing speech, eating, or opening       |

The combination suggests something that damages what should be protected or safe.

## Mnemonic

Think of 害 as **"something dangerous getting into your protected space"**:

- 宀 (roof) represents your home, shelter, or protected environment
- 口 (mouth) represents an opening or gap where danger can enter
- Together: harm that gets through your defenses and damages what should be safe
- Picture a storm getting through a crack in your roof
- Like something dangerous entering your safe space and causing damage
- The vulnerability when protection fails and harm gets through

This creates the image: **damage that penetrates your protective barriers and causes harm**.
