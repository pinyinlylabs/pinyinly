**🗣️ Pronunciation of 记 (jì)**

- **Pinyin:** jì
- **Tone: Fourth tone** — **falling** tone, like firmly stating: **"I remember!"**

**🔤 Breakdown:**

- **j** — Like "j" in "jeep" but softer, made with tongue tip down
- **ì** sounds like **"ee"** in "see", but with sharp fourth tone falling
- **jì** sounds like **"jee!"** with decisive falling tone

**🎯 Mastering the "j" sound:**

Chinese **j** is different from English:

1. **Tongue tip DOWN** — touching lower teeth (not curled back)
2. **Tongue body raised** — middle of tongue up toward roof of mouth
3. **Soft and precise** — like a gentle "j" in "jeep"
4. **No vibration** — clean, crisp sound

**🎯 Mastering the "ì" vowel:**

The **ì** is a high front vowel with fourth tone:

1. **Tongue high and front** — like "ee" in "see"
2. **Lips slightly spread** — not rounded
3. **Keep it clean** — pure vowel sound
4. **Fourth tone authority** — start high, fall sharply

**🎧 Tone tip:**

The **fourth tone** (ˋ) is **firm and definitive**:

Start **high and drop decisively** — like confidently stating you remember something: **"jì!"**

**Common mistakes:**

- ❌ English "j" with tongue curled — keep tongue tip down
- ❌ Soft tone — fourth tone should be strong and decisive
- ❌ Adding extra sound — keep it clean: just "jì"
- ✅ "jì" — soft "j" + clean "ee" + authoritative fall

**📝 Practice words:**

- 记 (jì) - "remember; record"
- 记住 (jì zhù) - "remember; keep in mind"
- 记录 (jì lù) - "record; minutes"
- 记者 (jì zhě) - "journalist; reporter"

**💡 Memory Tip:**

Think of **"Gee!"** — that sudden recognition when you remember something important. The soft "j"
and decisive falling tone capture that moment of remembering.
