**🗣️ Pronunciation of 展 (zhǎn)**

- **Pinyin:** zhǎn
- **Tone: Third tone** — **falling-rising** tone, like thoughtfully saying "Hmm, let's open this..."

**🔤 Breakdown:**

- **zh** like **"j"** in "judge" but with tongue curled back
- **ǎn** sounds like **"ahn"** with the third tone dip-and-rise pattern
- **zhǎn** sounds like **"jahn"** with a thoughtful dip-then-rise

**🎯 Mastering the Chinese "zh" sound:**

The **zh** in Chinese is **retroflex** (tongue curled back):

1. **Start with "j" in "judge"** — that buzzy sound
2. **Curl tongue tip back** — point it toward the roof of your mouth
3. **Keep it buzzy** — like "j" but deeper and more resonant
4. **Not like English "zh"** — it's more like a curled-back "j"

**🎯 Mastering the "ǎn" final:**

The **ǎn** ending combines vowel + nasal:

1. **Start with "ah"** — like in "father"
2. **Add "n"** — tongue tip touches the ridge behind upper teeth
3. **Apply third tone** — dip down then rise up
4. **Keep it crisp** — clear "n" ending

**Common mistakes:**

- ❌ "shan" (using "sh" instead of "zh") — missing the buzzy quality
- ❌ "jan" (using English "j") — needs the curled-back tongue
- ❌ "zha" (missing the "n") — needs the nasal ending
- ✅ "zhǎn" — curled-back buzzy "zh" + "ahn" + third tone

**🎧 Tone tip:**

The **third tone** (ˇ) is **falling then rising**:

Start **mid-level, dip down low, then rise up** — like the motion of opening something carefully:
down to grab, up to unfold.

**📝 Common Examples:**

- 展 (zhǎn) - "open; unfold; display; develop"
- 展开 (zhǎn kāi) - "unfold; spread out"
- 展示 (zhǎn shì) - "display; show"
- 发展 (fā zhǎn) - "develop; development"
- 展览 (zhǎn lǎn) - "exhibition"

**💡 Memory Tip:**

The third tone's dip-and-rise mimics the motion of opening/unfolding something — you dip down to
grasp it, then rise up as you open it!
