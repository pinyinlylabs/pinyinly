**🗣️ Pronunciation of 廴 (yǐn)**

- **Pinyin:** yǐn
- **Tone: Third tone** — **falling-rising** tone, like saying "uh-huh" when nodding

**🔤 Breakdown:**

- **y** like **"y"** in "yes"
- **ǐn** sounds like **"een"** but with third tone → dip down and rise up
- **yǐn** sounds like **"yeen"** with a dip-then-rise pattern

**🎧 Tone tip:**

The **third tone** (ˇ) is a **fall–then-rise** tone:

Start mid, dip down low, then rise back up, like when you're thinking or being thoughtful. **yǐn**
should have that contemplative quality.

**📝 Common Examples:**

廴 is a **radical component** that appears in characters related to walking or movement:

- 建 (jiàn) - "build" (contains 廴)
- 延 (yán) - "extend" (contains 廴)
- 廷 (tíng) - "court" (contains 廴)

**🔧 Special Notes:**

廴 is primarily used as a **radical** (building component) rather than as a standalone character in
modern Chinese. It represents the concept of "walking" or "movement."

**💡 Memory Tip:**

廴 as the "walking" radical uses the **meandering** third tone — like the **winding path** of
someone taking a thoughtful walk!
