**🗣️ Pronunciation of 座 (zuò)**

- **Pinyin:** zuò
- **Tone: Fourth tone** — sharp **falling** tone, like giving a firm command

**🔤 Breakdown:**

- **z** like **"ds"** in "reads" (voiced sound)
- **uò** sounds like **"waw"** but with fourth tone → sharp falling
- **zuò** sounds like **"dzwaw!"** with a sharp drop in pitch

**🎧 Tone tip:**

The **fourth tone** (ˋ) is a **sharp falling** tone:

Start high and drop quickly and decisively, like when you say "Sit!" as a command. **zuò** should
sound firm and direct.

**💡 Memory Tip:**

座 as a measure word for solid structures uses the **firm, decisive** fourth tone — like the **solid
foundation** of a mountain or building!
