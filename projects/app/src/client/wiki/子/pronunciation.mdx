**🗣️ Pronunciation of 子 (zǐ)**

- **Pinyin:** zǐ
- **Tone: Third tone** — **falling-rising** tone, like saying "uh-huh" when nodding

**🔤 Breakdown:**

- **z** like **"dz"** — similar to "ds" in "ads" but as one sound
- **ǐ** sounds like **"uh"** in "duh" but with third tone → dip down and rise up
- **zǐ** sounds like **"dzuh"** with a dip-then-rise

**🎯 Mastering the Chinese "z" sound:**

The **z** in Chinese is **different** from English:

1. **Tongue tip to teeth** — press tongue tip against upper teeth
2. **Make a "dz" sound** — like "ds" in "lids" but as one sound
3. **Keep it unaspirated** — no puff of air like English "z"
4. **Think "dz"** — not buzzy like English "z"

**🎧 Tone tip:**

The **third tone** (ˇ) is a **fall–then-rise** tone:

Say it like you're thoughtfully referring to a child: **"zǐ..."** — that contemplative tone pattern
is the **third tone**.

**📝 Common Examples:**

- 子 (zǐ) - "child; son"
- 孩子 (hái zi) - "child" (neutral tone on second syllable)
- 儿子 (ér zi) - "son"
- 男子 (nán zǐ) - "man; male"
- 女子 (nǚ zǐ) - "woman; female"
- 小子 (xiǎo zi) - "young man; guy" (colloquial)

**💡 Memory Tip:**

The third tone's dip-and-rise is like thoughtfully watching a **child** — you observe them with that
contemplative, caring tone!
