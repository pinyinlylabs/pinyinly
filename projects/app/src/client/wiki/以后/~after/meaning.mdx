## Character Analysis

### 以 (by means of)

以 shows **using something as starting point**:

- **人** (person) represents the reference
- **厶** (private) shows specific designation
- Together: using a particular moment as the baseline

### 后 (after)

后 depicts **following behind**:

- **彳** (step) shows walking movement
- **口** (mouth) represents announcement
- Together: what follows after or comes next in sequence

## Mnemonic

Think of 以后 as **"using this point as the starting line, everything that follows"**:

- 以 (by means of) marks the exact moment of division
- 后 (after) shows all the time extending forward from that point
- Like a race where the starting gun marks the beginning of 以后
- Picture a timeline with "now" marked and an arrow pointing to the future
