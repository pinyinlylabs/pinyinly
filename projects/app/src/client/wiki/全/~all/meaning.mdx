The character **全** means **"nothing missing"** — it’s used when something is complete, everyone is
included, or an action is done fully. You'll see it in everyday phrases like “whole family,” “all
came,” or “completely forgot.”

**全** expresses **completeness or totality**.  
Same meaning, different sentence positions.

### ⚠️ Watch out for: 全 vs 都

- **都** means “all” for plural subjects
- **全** adds emphasis to **completeness**

They’re often used together:  
→ 我们**全都**来了。(_We all came._)

### 🧠 Tip to remember

Imagine a whole cake with no slices missing — that’s **全**.
