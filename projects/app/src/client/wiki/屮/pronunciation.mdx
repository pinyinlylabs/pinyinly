**🗣️ Pronunciation of 屮 (chè)**

- **Pinyin:** chè
- **Tone: Fourth tone** — **falling** tone, like a sprout pushing through: **"Push!"**

**🔤 Breakdown:**

- **ch** like **"ch"** in "church" but with tongue curled back and a puff of air
- **è** sounds like **"eh"** in "meh" with sharp falling tone
- **chè** sounds like **"cheh"** with a decisive drop

**🎯 Mastering the Chinese "ch" sound:**

The **ch** in Chinese is **aspirated and retroflex**:

1. **Curl tongue tip back** — point it toward the roof of your mouth
2. **Add puff of air** — like English "ch" but stronger
3. **Make it deeper** — more resonant than English "ch"
4. **Think "church" with curled tongue** — but with more air

**🎧 Tone tip:**

The **fourth tone** (ˋ) is **sharp and falling**:

Start **high and drop decisively** — like the forceful motion of a sprout breaking through soil:
**"chè!"**

**📝 Common Examples:**

- 屮 (chè) - "sprout; grass radical" (primarily used as a radical)

**📚 Note on Usage:**

屮 is primarily used as a radical (部首) in Chinese characters rather than as a standalone word in
modern Chinese. It appears in characters like:

- 草 (cǎo) - "grass"
- 花 (huā) - "flower"
- 茶 (chá) - "tea"

**📚 Alternative Pronunciation:**

屮 can also be pronounced **tún** (second tone) in classical Chinese, but **chè** is the standard
modern pronunciation.

**💡 Memory Tip:**

The sharp falling tone mimics the decisive action of a sprout pushing up through the earth —
forceful and determined: **"chè!"**
