**🗣️ Pronunciation of 您 (nín)**

- **Pinyin:** nín
- **Tone: Second tone** — **rising** tone, like asking a question with respect

**🔤 Breakdown:**

- **n** like **"n"** in "nice"
- **ín** sounds like **"een"** in "seen" but with a rising tone
- **nín** sounds like **"neen?"** with a respectful, questioning rise

**🎧 Tone tip:**

The **second tone** (ˊ) is a **rising** tone:

Say it like you're politely asking "may I help you?" — **"nín?"** — that respectful upward
inflection is the second tone pattern.

**📝 Common Examples:**

- 您 (nín) - "you" (polite/formal)
- 您好 (nín hǎo) - "hello" (polite form)
- 您早 (nín zǎo) - "good morning" (polite)
- 谢谢您 (xiè xiè nín) - "thank you" (polite)

**🎭 Usage Note:**

您 (nín) is the **polite/formal** form of "you," used to show respect to:

- Elders
- People in authority
- Customers/clients
- Strangers in formal situations

Compare with 你 (nǐ) - the casual "you" used with friends and peers.

**💡 Memory Tip:**

The rising tone of **nín** sounds like you're lifting your voice to show respect — just like when
you politely ask someone a question!
