**🗣️ Pronunciation of 证 (zhèng)**

- **Pinyin:** zhèng
- **Tone: Fourth tone** — **falling** tone, like presenting official proof: **"Here's evidence!"**

**🔤 Breakdown:**

- **zh** — Retroflex sound made with curled tongue, like "j" in "judge" but buzzier
- **èng** sounds like **"uhng"** with fourth tone falling sharply
- **zhèng** sounds like **"juhng"** with authoritative, official tone

**🎯 Mastering the "zh" sound:**

Chinese **zh** is a retroflex sound:

1. **Curl tongue tip UP** — point toward roof of mouth
2. **Light contact** — tongue tip barely touches roof
3. **Add slight buzz** — like "j" in "judge" but with curled tongue
4. **Rich, warm sound** — deeper than regular "z"

**🎯 Mastering the "èng" final:**

The **èng** combines vowel + nasal:

1. **Start with "uh"** — neutral, relaxed vowel (schwa)
2. **Add "ng"** — back of tongue touches soft palate
3. **Keep it neutral** — not "ah" or "eh", just relaxed "uh"
4. **Fourth tone authority** — start high, drop firmly
5. **Strong nasal** — let it resonate

**🎧 Tone tip:**

The **fourth tone** (ˋ) is **official and authoritative**:

Start **high and drop decisively** — like presenting a certificate or document: **"zhèng!"**
(Proof!)

**Common mistakes:**

- ❌ Regular "z" instead of retroflex "zh" — must curl tongue
- ❌ "zang" with wrong vowel — it's neutral "uh", not "ah"
- ❌ Weak nasal — the "ng" should be strong and clear
- ❌ Wrong tone — fourth tone must be sharp and falling
- ✅ "zhèng" — curled "zh" + neutral "uh" + strong "ng" + falling tone

**📝 Practice words:**

- 证 (zhèng) - "certificate; proof; evidence"
- 证件 (zhèng jiàn) - "papers; documents; ID"
- 证明 (zhèng míng) - "prove; certificate"
- 保证 (bǎo zhèng) - "guarantee; ensure"

**💡 Memory Tip:**

Think of firmly stamping an official document — **"ZHENG!"** — with that authoritative, final tone
that makes it official and binding.
