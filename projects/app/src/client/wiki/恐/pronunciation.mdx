**🗣️ Pronunciation of 恐 (kǒng)**

- **Pinyin:** kǒng
- **Tone: Third tone** — **dipping** tone, goes down then up

**🔤 Breakdown:**

- **k** like **"k"** in "key" but with a puff of air
- **ǒng** sounds like **"ong"** in "song" but with third tone → dip down and up
- **kǒng** sounds like **"kong"** with a dipping tone

**🎯 Mastering the "k" sound:**

The **k** in Chinese is **aspirated** (has a puff of air):

1. **Start with "k"** like in "key"
2. **Add a strong puff of air** — hold your hand in front of your mouth and feel the air
3. **Make it breathy** — like blowing out a candle
4. **Think "k" + breath**

**🎯 Mastering the "ǒng" final:**

The **ǒng** ending is **nasalized and rounded**:

1. **Start with "o"** like in "song"
2. **Add "ng"** with back of tongue touching soft palate
3. **Make it round** — lips slightly pursed like "o"
4. **Add nasal quality** — let sound resonate in your nose and throat

**🎧 Tone tip:**

The **third tone** (ˇ) is a **dipping** tone:

Start **mid-low, go lower, then rise up** — like expressing growing fear or uncertainty:
**"kǒng..."**

**📝 Common Examples:**

- 恐 (kǒng) - "fear; dread; terror"
- 恐怕 (kǒng pà) - "I'm afraid that...; probably"
- 恐怖 (kǒng bù) - "terror; horror"
- 恐龙 (kǒng lóng) - "dinosaur"
- 恐惧 (kǒng jù) - "fear; dread"

恐 is most commonly used in compound words. 恐怕 (kǒng pà) is especially common, meaning "I'm afraid
that..." or "probably" in a polite way.

**💡 Memory Tip:**

The dipping third tone **kǒng** sounds like someone's voice trembling with fear — that uncertain,
wavering tone perfectly captures the meaning of "terror"!
