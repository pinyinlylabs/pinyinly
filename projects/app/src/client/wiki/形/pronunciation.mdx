**🗣️ Pronunciation of 形 (xíng)**

- **Pinyin:** xíng
- **Tone: Second tone** — **rising** tone, like asking a question: **"Shing?"**

**🔤 Breakdown:**

- **x** — This is tricky! It's like **"sh"** in "she" but **breathier** and **sharper**
- **íng** sounds like **"ing"** in "ring" but with a rising tone
- **xíng** sounds like a breathy **"shing?"** with a questioning rise

**🎯 Mastering the "x" sound:**

The **x** in Chinese is **not** like English "x" (ks). Instead:

1. **Start with "sh"** like in "she"
2. **Add more breath** — make it airier and sharper
3. **Keep your tongue tip down** — don't let it touch the roof of your mouth

**🎧 Tone tip:**

The **second tone** (´) is a **rising** tone:

Say it like you're asking "What shape is this?": **"xíng?"** — that's the tone pattern of **xíng**.

**📝 Common Examples:**

- 形 (xíng) - "form; shape"
- 形式 (xíng shì) - "form; format"
- 形成 (xíng chéng) - "to form; to take shape"
- 形状 (xíng zhuàng) - "shape; form"
- 形象 (xíng xiàng) - "image; figure"

**💡 Memory Tip:**

Think of **"shing?"** with a questioning rise — when asking about a **form** or **shape**, you
naturally raise your voice like the second tone!
