**🗣️ Pronunciation of 鼎 (dǐng)**

- **Pinyin:** dǐng
- **Tone: Third tone** — **falling-rising** tone, like saying "uh-huh" when nodding

**🔤 Breakdown:**

- **d** like **"d"** in "ding"
- **ǐng** sounds like **"ing"** in "sing" but with third tone → dip down and rise up
- **dǐng** sounds like **"ding"** with a dip-then-rise

**🎧 Tone tip:**

The **third tone** (ˇ) is a **fall–then-rise** tone:

Say it like you're thoughtfully examining an ancient bronze cauldron: **"dǐng..."** — that
contemplative tone pattern when appreciating historical artifacts.

**📝 Common Examples:**

- 鼎 (dǐng) - "cauldron; tripod vessel"
- 鼎盛 (dǐng shèng) - "flourishing; at its peak"
- 九鼎 (jiǔ dǐng) - "nine tripod cauldrons" (symbol of imperial power)
- 问鼎 (wèn dǐng) - "to contend for power"

**💡 Memory Tip:**

鼎 sounds like "ding" with a falling-rising tone — imagine the resonant **"dǐng"** sound an ancient
bronze cauldron makes when struck, with that distinctive dipping tone.
