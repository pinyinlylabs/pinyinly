| **也**    | Also, too - indicates inclusion/possibility                   |
| **许**    | Allow, permit - from speech radical 讠 + 午 (noon/permission) |

The combination suggests "also allowing for the possibility" or "it's also permitted that..."

## Mnemonic

Think of 也许 as **"also allowing that it might be"**:

- 也 (yě) means "also" - opens up additional possibilities
- 许 (xǔ) means "permit/allow" - gives permission for uncertainty
- Together: allowing that something else might also be true
- Picture someone saying "well, it's also possible that..."
- Like adding "but then again..." to show you're not 100% certain
- The phrase creates space for doubt or alternative possibilities

This creates the meaning: **opening the door to other possibilities**.

statements. In Chinese culture, expressing uncertainty with 也许 shows humility and prevents others
from losing face if they disagree. It's a way of being diplomatic while still expressing your
thoughts. This aligns with Confucian values of harmony and avoiding direct confrontation, allowing
conversations to flow more smoothly by acknowledging that multiple perspectives may be valid.
