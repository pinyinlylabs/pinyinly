**🗣️ Pronunciation of 夂 (zhǐ)**

- **Pinyin:** zhǐ
- **Tone: Third tone** — **falling-rising** tone, like saying "uh-huh" when nodding

**🔤 Breakdown:**

- **zh** like **"j"** in "judge" (but with tongue curled back)
- **ǐ** sounds like **"ir"** in "sir" but with third tone → dip down and rise up
- **zhǐ** sounds like **"jir"** with a dip-then-rise

**🎯 Mastering the Chinese "zh" sound:**

The **zh** in Chinese has **retroflex tongue position**:

1. **Curl tongue back** — tip pointing toward roof of mouth
2. **Make "j" sound** — like "judge" but with curled tongue
3. **Deeper resonance** — sounds richer than English "j"
4. **Keep it smooth** — not harsh or buzzy

**🎧 Tone tip:**

The **third tone** (ˇ) is a **fall–then-rise** tone:

Say it like you're thinking or being thoughtful: **"zhǐ..."** — that's the tone pattern of going
somewhere thoughtfully.

**📝 Note on Usage:**

夂 (zhǐ) is primarily a **radical** component meaning "go" or "walk slowly." It appears in many
characters related to movement but is rarely used independently in modern Chinese.

**📝 Characters containing 夂:**

- 处 (chù) - "place" (contains 夂)
- 夏 (xià) - "summer" (contains 夂)
- 复 (fù) - "return" (contains 夂)
- 各 (gè) - "each" (contains 夂)

**💡 Memory Tip:**

As a radical meaning "go," think of the **third tone's dip and rise** like someone hesitating before
walking — **"zhǐ..."** (should I go?)
