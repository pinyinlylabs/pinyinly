**🗣️ Pronunciation of 际 (jì)**

- **Pinyin:** jì
- **Tone: Fourth tone** — sharp **falling** tone, like giving a command

**🔤 Breakdown:**

- **j** like **"j"** in "jeep" (but without the "ee" sound)
- **ì** sounds like **"ee"** in "see" but with fourth tone → sharp drop
- **jì** sounds like **"jee"** with a sharp fall

**🎧 Tone tip:**

The **fourth tone** (ˋ) is a **sharp falling** tone:

Say it like you're pointing to a boundary line decisively: **"jì!"** — that definitive, falling
tone.

**📝 Common Examples:**

- 际 (jì) - "border, boundary, occasion"
- 国际 (guó jì) - "international"
- 实际 (shí jì) - "actual, practical"
- 边际 (biān jì) - "boundary, margin"

**💡 Memory Tip:**

Think of drawing a firm line at a border - that decisive fourth tone matches the definitive nature
of **际** meaning "border/boundary"!
