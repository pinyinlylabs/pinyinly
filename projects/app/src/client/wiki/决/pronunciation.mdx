**🗣️ Pronunciation of 决 (jué)**

- **Pinyin:** jué
- **Tone: Second tone** — **rising** tone, like asking a question

**🔤 Breakdown:**

- **j** — This is like **"j"** in "jeep" but **softer** and more like **"zh"** in "zhee"
- **ué** sounds like **"way"** but with a rising tone
- **jué** sounds like **"jway?"** with a questioning rise

**🎯 Mastering the "j" sound:**

The **j** in Chinese is **not** like English "j" (as in "jump"). Instead:

1. **Start with "zh"** like in "zhee"
2. **Make it softer** — less harsh than English "j"
3. **Keep your tongue relaxed** — don't press too hard
4. **Think of it as a gentle "zh" sound**

The **second tone** (´) is **rising**:

Say it like you're asking for a decision: **"jué?"** — with that upward inflection.

**💡 Memory Tip:**

When making a decision, you might ask yourself questions — that rising tone captures the questioning
nature of deciding!
