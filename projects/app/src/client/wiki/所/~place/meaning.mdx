    story: `A true **place** (所) you can call your own is where you’ve put up a **door** to mark your space and keep an axe handy by the entrance for wood, work, and protection. Wherever there’s a **door** and an **axe**, that’s your PLACE (所).`,

**{hanzi}** generally means **{gloss}** in modern Mandarin. It’s pronounced **{pinyin}**.
