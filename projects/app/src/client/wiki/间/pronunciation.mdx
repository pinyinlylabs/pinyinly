**🗣️ Pronunciation of 间 (jiān)**

- **Pinyin:** jiān
- **Tone: First tone** — **high and flat** tone, like a steady note

**🔤 Breakdown:**

- **j** like **"j"** in "jeep"
- **iān** sounds like **"yen"** but held steady and high
- **jiān** sounds like **"jyen"** with a steady high pitch

**🎧 Tone tip:**

The **first tone** (ˉ) is a **high flat** tone:

Keep your voice high and steady throughout: **"jiān"** — like defining a clear space.

**📝 Common Examples:**

- 间 (jiān) - "room, space"
- 时间 (shí jiān) - "time"
- 房间 (fáng jiān) - "room"
- 中间 (zhōng jiān) - "middle, between"
- 洗手间 (xǐ shǒu jiān) - "bathroom"

**📝 Special Notes:**

间 has another pronunciation **jiàn** (fourth tone) meaning "gap" or "interval," but **jiān** (first
tone) is more commonly used for "room" or "space."

The character contains the door radical 门, which makes sense since rooms are enclosed by doors.

**💡 Memory Tip:**

A **room** is a defined **space** — keep your tone high and steady like the clear boundaries of
**jiān**!
