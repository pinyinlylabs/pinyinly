## Visual Breakdown

目的 combines vision with destination:

| Component | Visual Description                                                   |
| --------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **目**    | Eye/vision - represents seeing, observation, and focused attention  |
| **的**    | Target/bull's eye - represents the target or intended destination   |

## Mnemonic

Think of 目的 as **the target that your eye focuses on**:

- 目 (eye) + 的 (target) = "the target your eye aims for"
- Like an archer focusing their eye on the bull's eye target
- The destination that you keep your vision fixed upon
- What you're "aiming for" with focused intention

This creates the meaning: **the intended target or goal of focused effort**.
