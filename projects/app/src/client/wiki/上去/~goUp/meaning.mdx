## Mnemonic

Think of 上去 as **"going toward the upper direction"**:

- 上 points upward like an arrow or finger pointing up
- 去 shows the action of going/moving
- Together: moving in the upward direction
- Like climbing stairs, going uphill, or ascending to a higher floor

The combination creates clear directional movement from lower to higher position.
