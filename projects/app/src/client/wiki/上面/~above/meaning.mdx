| **面**    | Face/surface - represents the visible surface or side of things |

## Mnemonic

Think of 上面 as **the upper surface that faces you**:

- 上 (up/above) + 面 (face/surface) = the surface that is "up" or "above"
- Like the "face" or visible part of something that's positioned higher
- The top surface of a table that faces upward toward you
- The upper side of an object that you can see when looking up

Together they create: **the surface/side that is positioned above**.

Compare with 下面 (xiàmiàn) "below/underneath" for the opposite spatial relationship.
