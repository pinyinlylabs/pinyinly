**🗣️ Pronunciation of 警 (jǐng)**

- **Pinyin:** jǐng
- **Tone: Third tone** — **falling-rising** tone, like saying "uh-huh" when nodding

**🔤 Breakdown:**

- **j** like **"j"** in "jeep" but softer
- **ǐng** sounds like **"ing"** in "ring" but with third tone → dip down and rise up
- **jǐng** sounds like **"jing"** with a dip-then-rise

**🎧 Tone tip:**

The **third tone** (ˇ) is a **fall–then-rise** tone:

Say it like you're being alert: **"jǐng..."** — that cautious, watchful tone pattern.

**📝 Common Examples:**

- 警 (jǐng) - "warn; alert"
- 警察 (jǐng chá) - "police"
- 警告 (jǐng gào) - "warning"
- 交警 (jiāo jǐng) - "traffic police"
- 报警 (bào jǐng) - "call the police"

**💡 Memory Tip:**

Think of 警 as a "warning" — when you warn someone, you speak with careful attention, checking their
response, just like the third tone's thoughtful dip-and-rise pattern!
