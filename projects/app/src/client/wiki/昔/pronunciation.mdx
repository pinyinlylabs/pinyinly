**🗣️ Pronunciation of 昔 (xī)**

- **Pinyin:** xī
- **Tone: First tone** — **high and flat** tone, like a steady note

**🔤 Breakdown:**

- **x** — This is tricky! It's like **"sh"** in "she" but **breathier** and **sharper**
- **ī** sounds like **"ee"** in "see" but held steady and high
- **xī** sounds like a breathy **"shee"** with a steady high pitch

**🎯 Mastering the "x" sound:**

The **x** in Chinese is **not** like English "x" (ks). Instead:

1. **Start with "sh"** like in "she"
2. **Add more breath** — make it airier and sharper
3. **Keep your tongue tip down** — don't let it touch the roof of your mouth

**📝 Common Examples:**

- 昔 (xī) - "in the past; former times"
- 昔日 (xī rì) - "former days; in the past"
