| **习**    | Originally depicted a young bird flapping wings to learn flight |

The ancient form showed a bird (羽 wings) with repeated movement, representing the natural process
of learning through repetition and practice.

## Mnemonic

Think of 习 as **"a young bird learning to fly"**:

- Picture a baby bird on a branch flapping its wings repeatedly
- Each flap builds wing strength and coordination
- The repetitive motion gradually develops into skillful flight
- Through practice, awkward movements become graceful
- What starts as struggle becomes natural ability
- The persistence required to master any skill

This creates the image: **developing mastery through repeated, dedicated practice**.

## Cultural Context

习 embodies the Chinese educational philosophy that emphasizes diligent practice and gradual
mastery. This concept is fundamental to traditional Chinese learning methods, where repetition and
persistent effort are valued over quick results. The phrase "熟能生巧" (shú néng shēng qiǎo) -
"practice makes perfect" - reflects this cultural belief. In Confucian tradition, 习 represents not
just skill acquisition but character development through disciplined effort, making it central to
personal cultivation and moral growth.
