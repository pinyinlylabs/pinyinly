- The feathers component (羽) represents repeated wing movements
- The white component (白) shows the pure, clean process of learning
- Like a young bird repeatedly practicing until flight becomes natural
- Shows learning through repetition and gradual improvement
- Combines action (feathers) with purity of purpose (white)

This creates the image: **repeated practice making actions pure and natural**.
