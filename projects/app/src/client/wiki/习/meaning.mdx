persistent effort are valued over quick results. The phrase "熟能生巧" (shú néng shēng qiǎo) -
"practice makes perfect" - reflects this cultural belief. In Confucian tradition, 习 represents not
just skill acquisition but character development through disciplined effort, making it central to
personal cultivation and moral growth.
