**🗣️ Pronunciation of 属 (shǔ)**

- **Pinyin:** shǔ
- **Tone: Third tone** — **falling-rising** tone, like considering where something belongs: "Hmm..."

**🔤 Breakdown:**

- **sh** like **"sh"** in "she" but with tongue tip curled back slightly
- **ǔ** sounds like **"oo"** in "book" with the third tone dip-and-rise pattern
- **shǔ** sounds like **"shoo"** with a thoughtful dip-then-rise

**🎯 Mastering the Chinese "sh" sound:**

The **sh** in Chinese is **slightly retroflex**:

1. **Start with English "sh"** — like in "shoe"
2. **Curl tongue back slightly** — tip pointing toward roof of mouth
3. **Make it deeper** — more resonant than English "sh"
4. **Keep it soft** — not harsh or hissing

**🎧 Tone tip:**

The **third tone** (ˇ) is **falling then rising**:

Start **mid-level, dip down low, then rise up** — like the mental process of figuring out where
something belongs: you consider (dip), then realize (rise).

**📝 Common Examples:**

- 属 (shǔ) - "belong to; be classified as"
- 属于 (shǔ yú) - "belong to; pertain to"
- 家属 (jiā shǔ) - "family members; dependents"
- 附属 (fù shǔ) - "subsidiary; attached to"

**📚 Note on Multiple Pronunciations:**

属 also has another pronunciation **shù** (fourth tone) in certain contexts:

- 属实 (shù shí) - "be true; be real"
- 金属 (jīn shù) - "metal"

**💡 Memory Tip:**

The third tone's contemplative rise and fall matches the thinking process of figuring out where
something belongs — you ponder (dip) then understand (rise): "Ah, it belongs here!"
