## Mnemonic

Think of 不要 as **"don't want this to happen"**:

- 不 (not) + 要 (want/need) = "do not want/need"
- Like pushing away something you don't want
- A strong signal to avoid or stop an action
- The negation of desire or necessity

This creates the meaning: **actively don't do this; it's prohibited or unwanted**.
