## Mnemonic

Think of 丨 as **a standing stick or pole**:

- A simple stick planted vertically in the ground
- A pillar or column standing upright
- A single chopstick standing on end
- The stroke you make when drawing a straight line down

This represents the fundamental concept of **vertical direction and straightness**.

## Core Meaning & Usage

丨 represents **vertical orientation and linear structure**. It appears in:

1. **Basic characters**: 十 (ten), 中 (middle), 个 (individual)
2. **As a stroke component**: Provides vertical structure to characters
3. **Positional meaning**: Often indicates central or supporting elements
4. **Character balance**: Creates symmetry and structure

## Examples in Characters

- **十** (shí) - "ten" (vertical line crossed by horizontal)
- **中** (zhōng) - "middle" (vertical line through center)
- **个** (gè) - "individual" (combines with other strokes)
- **小** (xiǎo) - "small" (vertical line with dots)
- **川** (chuān) - "river" (three vertical lines like flowing water)

## As a Building Block

丨 is one of the Eight Basic Strokes (八种基本笔画) in Chinese calligraphy:

- It teaches **proper brush control** and **steady hand movement**
- Represents **strength and stability** in character structure
- Often forms the **backbone** of more complex characters

The vertical line is fundamental to understanding how Chinese characters are constructed and
balanced.
