**🗣️ Pronunciation of 丨 (gǔn)**

- **Pinyin:** gǔn
- **Tone: Third tone** — **falling-rising** tone, like saying "uh-huh" when nodding

**🔤 Breakdown:**

- **g** like **"g"** in "go"
- **ǔn** sounds like **"oon"** in "moon" but with third tone → dip down and rise up
- **gǔn** sounds like **"goon"** with a dip-then-rise

**🎧 Tone tip:**

The **third tone** (ˇ) is a **fall–then-rise** tone:

Say it like you're thinking or considering: **"gǔn..."** — that thoughtful dip-then-rise pattern.

**📝 Common Examples:**

- 丨 (gǔn) - "line" (vertical stroke radical)
- 滚 (gǔn) - "to roll"
- 棍 (gùn) - "stick" (different tone, fourth tone)

**💡 Memory Tip:**

Think of a **vertical line** (丨) rolling like a **stick** — the **gǔn** sound mimics the motion of
something rolling back and forth!
