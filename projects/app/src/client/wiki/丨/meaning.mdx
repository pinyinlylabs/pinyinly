## As a Building Block

丨 is one of the Eight Basic Strokes (八种基本笔画) in Chinese calligraphy:

- It teaches **proper brush control** and **steady hand movement**

- Often forms the **backbone** of more complex characters

The vertical line is fundamental to understanding how Chinese characters are constructed and
balanced.
