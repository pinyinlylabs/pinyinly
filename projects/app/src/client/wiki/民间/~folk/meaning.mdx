## Mnemonic

Think of 民间 as **"in the spaces where ordinary people gather and live"**:

- 民 (mín) represents common people, ordinary citizens
- 间 (jiān) represents the spaces, intervals, or areas between things
- Together: the informal spaces where regular people live and interact
- Picture village squares, neighborhoods, and community gathering places
- Like the grassroots areas where folk culture naturally develops
