**🗣️ Pronunciation of 建 (jiàn)**

- **Pinyin:** jiàn
- **Tone: Fourth tone** — sharp **falling** tone, like giving a firm command

**🔤 Breakdown:**

- **j** like **"j"** in "jeep" but softer, more like "gee"
- **iàn** sounds like **"yen"** but with fourth tone → sharp falling
- **jiàn** sounds like **"gyen!"** with a sharp drop in pitch

**🎧 Tone tip:**

The **fourth tone** (ˋ) is a **sharp falling** tone:

Start high and drop quickly and decisively, like when you say "Build!" as a strong command. **jiàn**
should sound firm and authoritative.

**💡 Memory Tip:**

建 means "build" — the **sharp, decisive** fourth tone sounds like giving a **strong command** to
start construction work!
