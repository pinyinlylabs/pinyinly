| **云**    | Pictograph of swirling clouds, simplified from ancient form |

The ancient form showed curving lines representing the flowing, changing nature of clouds. The
modern form retains the essence of something flowing and ethereal.

## Mnemonic

Think of 云 as **"floating wisps in the sky"**:

- The top stroke (一) represents the horizon or sky
- The curved middle part (厶) looks like swirling vapor
- The bottom part suggests the floating, billowy nature
- Picture white fluffy clouds drifting across a blue sky
- Imagine the gentle movement and changing shapes
- The temporary, ever-changing nature of cloud formations

This creates the image: **soft white masses floating and transforming in the blue sky**.

## Cultural Context

云 carries rich symbolic meaning in Chinese culture, representing both the physical phenomenon and
abstract concepts of change, mystery, and transcendence. In traditional Chinese art and poetry,
clouds symbolize the ethereal realm between earth and heaven, often associated with immortals and
spiritual ascension. The phrase "行云流水" (xíng yún liú shuǐ) - "flowing clouds and running
water" - describes natural, effortless movement. In modern times, 云 has gained new significance in
technology, representing distributed computing and digital connectivity.
