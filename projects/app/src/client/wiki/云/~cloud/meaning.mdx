| **二**    | Two horizontal lines representing sky layers          |
| **厶**    | Curved strokes representing swirling cloud formations |

The character originally showed the swirling, layered nature of clouds drifting across different
levels of the sky.

## Mnemonic

Think of 云 as **"swirling layers in the sky"**:

- The top horizontal strokes (二) represent the sky or atmosphere
- The bottom curved part (厶) looks like swirling wind or vapor
- Together: swirling vapor formations in layers of sky
- Picture fluffy white clouds drifting across blue sky
- The character's flowing strokes mirror how clouds move and change shape
- Imagine watching clouds form and transform overhead

This creates the image: **nature's floating formations above us**.

clouds embody the principle of wu wei (无为) - effortless action - as they drift naturally without
forcing their path. The phrase "行云流水" (xíng yún liú shuǐ) - "moving clouds and flowing water" -
describes smooth, natural movement and is used to praise graceful writing, martial arts, or any
skillful performance that appears effortless.
