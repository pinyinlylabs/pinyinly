**💡 Special Notes:**

囗 is primarily used as a radical component in Chinese characters rather than as a standalone word.
It represents the concept of enclosure or surrounding. When you see this radical in characters, it
often relates to something being enclosed, surrounded, or contained within boundaries. It's
different from 口 (kǒu, mouth) - note that 囗 is larger and more square-shaped.
