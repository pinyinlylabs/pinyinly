## Mnemonic

Think of 勿 as **"a flowing action being cut off and stopped"**:

- The curved lines suggest natural flow or movement
- The crossing strokes represent barriers that stop the flow
- Together: a clear signal to stop, halt, or avoid something
- Picture a flowing river being dammed to stop the water
- Like a "Do Not Enter" sign that blocks your path
- The gesture of putting up your hand to say "stop, don't do that"

This creates the image: **a clear barrier that says "do not proceed"**.
