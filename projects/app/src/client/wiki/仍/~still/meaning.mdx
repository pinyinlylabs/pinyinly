## Character Analysis

### 仍 (still)

仍 depicts **something remaining unchanged**:

- **亻** (person radical) represents the subject experiencing continuity
- **乃** (then/still) shows the continuing state
- Together: a person or situation that remains in the same condition
- Emphasizes that expected change hasn't occurred

## Mnemonic

Think of 仍 as **"a person standing in the same spot, unchanged"**:

- Picture someone you expected to move or change, but they're still there
- Like checking on something and finding it exactly as before
- The character suggests stubborn persistence or unchanged status
- Often implies some surprise that change hasn't happened
