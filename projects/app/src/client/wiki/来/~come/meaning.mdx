- The tree-like structure (木) shows something substantial moving toward you
- The small dots (丶) suggest details becoming visible as something approaches
- Like seeing a fruit-laden tree coming into view as you walk toward it
- The overall shape suggests **movement toward the observer**

This creates the image: **something valuable approaching from the distance**.
