**🗣️ Pronunciation of 向 (xiàng)**

- **Pinyin:** xiàng
- **Tone: Fourth tone** — sharp **falling** tone, like giving a command: **"Down!"**

**🔤 Breakdown:**

- **x** — This is tricky! It's like **"sh"** in "she" but **breathier** and **sharper**
- **iàng** sounds like **"yang"** in "yang" but with a sharp falling tone
- **xiàng** sounds like a breathy **"shyang!"** with a sharp drop

**🎯 Mastering the "x" sound:**

The **x** in Chinese is **not** like English "x" (ks). Instead:

1. **Start with "sh"** like in "she"
2. **Add more breath** — make it airier and sharper
3. **Keep your tongue tip down** — don't let it touch the roof of your mouth

Think **"she"** but with a sharp breath of air!

**🎧 Tone tip:**

The **fourth tone** (ˋ) starts **high** and drops **fast**:

Say it like you're pointing in a direction decisively — that's the energy of **xiàng**.

**📝 Common Examples:**

- 方向 (fāng xiàng) - "direction"
- 向前 (xiàng qián) - "forward"
- 向上 (xiàng shàng) - "upward"
- 向左 (xiàng zuǒ) - "to the left"
- 面向 (miàn xiàng) - "face toward"
