## Visual Breakdown

室 combines **roof + arrival** to show enclosed indoor space.

| Component | Visual Description                                     |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| **宀**    | Roof radical (宀) - indicates building or shelter      |
| **至**    | Arrive/reach (至) - suggests a destination or endpoint |

## Mnemonic

Think of 室 as **a place under a roof where you arrive and stay**:

- The roof radical (宀) shows this is about indoor, covered spaces
- The "arrive" component (至) suggests reaching a destination
- Like arriving at a room where you can stay and rest
- A enclosed space under a roof that serves as a destination

This captures the concept of a room as both a physical shelter and a place of purpose or
destination.
