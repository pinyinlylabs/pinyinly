| **边**    | Side, edge, border - movement radical 辶 + 力 (strength)                  |

## Mnemonic

Think of 北边 as **"the side where it's cold and away from the sun"**:

- 北 (běi) represents the north direction - cold, away from the warming sun
- 边 (biān) represents a side, edge, or boundary area
- Together: the side/area that faces the cold north direction
- Picture standing in a room and pointing to the north-facing side
- Like the shadowy, cooler side of a building that faces north
- The edge of your property that's oriented toward the north

This creates the image: **the boundary or area that faces toward the cold north**.

## Cultural Context

In Chinese culture and feng shui, the 北边 (north side) has special significance. Traditionally,
it's considered the less favorable direction as it faces away from the sun's warmth. In
architecture, the north side receives less sunlight, so understanding 北边 is important for housing,
gardening, and spatial planning in Chinese culture.
