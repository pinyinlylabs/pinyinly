## Cultural Context

In Chinese culture and feng shui, the 北边 (north side) has special significance. Traditionally,
it's considered the less favorable direction as it faces away from the sun's warmth. In
architecture, the north side receives less sunlight, so understanding 北边 is important for housing,
gardening, and spatial planning in Chinese culture.
