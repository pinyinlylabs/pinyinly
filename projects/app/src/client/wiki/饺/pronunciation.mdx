**🗣️ Pronunciation of 饺 (jiǎo)**

- **Pinyin:** jiǎo
- **Tone: Third tone** — **falling-rising** tone, like saying "uh-huh" when nodding thoughtfully

**🔤 Breakdown:**

- **j** like **"j"** in "jeep" (but softer, more like "gee")
- **iǎo** sounds like **"yow"** but with the third tone → dip down and rise up
- **jiǎo** sounds like **"jee-yow"** with a dip-then-rise pattern

**🎧 Tone tip:**

The **third tone** (ˇ) is a **fall–then-rise** tone. Start middle, dip down low, then rise back up -
like you're contemplating something delicious.

**📝 Common Examples:**

- 饺子 (jiǎo zi) - "dumpling"
- 水饺 (shuǐ jiǎo) - "boiled dumpling"
- 煎饺 (jiān jiǎo) - "pan-fried dumpling"
- 蒸饺 (zhēng jiǎo) - "steamed dumpling"

**💡 Memory Tip:**

When you see dumplings and think "Mmm, those look good..." - that contemplative, appreciative tone
matches the dip-and-rise third tone of **jiǎo**.
