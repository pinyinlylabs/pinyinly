## Directional Contrast: 来 vs 去

Understanding the speaker's perspective:

- **上来** (shàng lái) - come up (toward speaker)
- **上去** (shàng qù) - go up (away from speaker)
- **下来** (xià lái) - come down (toward speaker)
- **下去** (xià qù) - go down (away from speaker)

## Grammar Patterns

上来 functions as a **directional complement**:

- **[verb] + 上来**: [verb] + upward toward speaker
- **上来 + [verb]**: come up + [verb]
- **快 + 上来**: quickly come up
- **一起 + 上来**: come up together

## Perspective Importance

The choice between 来 and 去 depends on the speaker's location:

- If speaker is **upstairs**: 上来 (come up to me)
- If speaker is **downstairs**: 上去 (go up there)
- If speaker is **neutral**: either can work depending on reference point

## Cultural Context

上来 reflects Chinese spatial reference systems:

- **Speaker-centered**: Direction always relative to speaker's position
- **Invitation implied**: 上来 often suggests welcome or invitation
- **Hierarchy consideration**: Coming "up" to someone may show respect
- **Physical practicality**: Essential for clear communication about movement
