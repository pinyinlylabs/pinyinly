| **八**    | Bottom part spreading out like supports or legs               |

## Mnemonic

Think of 六 as **a roof supported by spreading beams**:

- The top part (亠) looks like a traditional Chinese roof
- The bottom part (八) resembles roof supports spreading outward
- Like a pavilion or small building with six supporting elements
- The roof protects what's beneath, suggesting completeness

This structure reflects six as a stable, well-supported number.
