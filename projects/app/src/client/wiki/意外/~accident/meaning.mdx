| Component | Meaning                                                  |

| **意**    | Intention, meaning, thought - heart 心 + sound 音       |
| **外**    | Outside, external - evening 夕 + divination 卜          |

The combination suggests something "outside of intention" or beyond what was planned.

## Mnemonic

Think of 意外 as **"something outside of what your heart intended"**:

- 意 (yì) represents your intention, plan, or what you had in mind
- 外 (wài) represents outside, beyond, or external to your expectations
- Together: events that fall outside of your intended plans
- Picture carefully planning something, then being surprised by an unexpected event
- Like having your day disrupted by something you never saw coming
- The moment when reality goes outside the boundaries of your expectations

This creates the image: **events that happen outside the boundaries of what you planned or expected**.
