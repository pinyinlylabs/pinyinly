**🗣️ Pronunciation of 职 (zhí)**

- **Pinyin:** zhí
- **Tone: Second tone** — **rising** tone, like asking a question "what?"

**🔤 Breakdown:**

- **zh** like **"j"** in "judge" (but with tongue curled back)
- **í** sounds like **"ee"** in "see", but with second tone → rise up
- **zhí** sounds like **"jee"** with a questioning rise

**🎧 Tone tip:**

The **second tone** (´) is a **rising** tone:

Start low and rise up, like you're asking "What's your job?" — that's the inquiring tone pattern of
**zhí**.

**📝 Common Examples:**

- 职 (zhí) - "duty, job, position"
- 职业 (zhí yè) - "profession, occupation"
- 职位 (zhí wèi) - "position, post"
- 职工 (zhí gōng) - "employee, worker"
- 职责 (zhí zé) - "duty, responsibility"
- 在职 (zài zhí) - "on duty, in office"

**💡 Memory Tip:**

When someone asks about your **zhí** (job), they use that rising, curious second tone — "What do you
do?"
