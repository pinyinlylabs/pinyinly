**🗣️ Pronunciation of 努 (nǔ)**

- **Pinyin:** nǔ
- **Tone: Third tone** — **falling-rising** tone, like saying "uh-huh" when nodding

**🔤 Breakdown:**

- **n** like **"n"** in "new"
- **ǔ** sounds like **"oo"** in "book" but with third tone → dip down and rise up
- **nǔ** sounds like **"noo"** with a dip-then-rise

**🎧 Tone tip:**

The **third tone** (ˇ) is a **fall–then-rise** tone:

Say it like you're thinking about making an effort: **"nǔ..."** — that thoughtful dip-then-rise
pattern.

- 努 (nǔ) - "exert"
- 努力 (nǔ lì) - "effort, work hard"

tone at the end!
