**🗣️ Pronunciation of 丶 (zhǔ)**

- **Pinyin:** zhǔ
- **Tone: Third tone** — **falling-rising** tone, like saying "uh-huh" when nodding

**🔤 Breakdown:**

- **zh** — This is like **"j"** in "jump" but with the tongue curled back slightly
- **ǔ** sounds like **"oo"** in "book" but with third tone → dip down and rise up
- **zhǔ** sounds like **"joo"** with a dip-then-rise

**🎯 Mastering the "zh" sound:**

The **zh** in Chinese is **not** like English "z". Instead:

1. **Start with "j"** like in "jump"
2. **Curl your tongue tip back** slightly toward the roof of your mouth
3. **Keep it soft** — not as harsh as English "j"

**🎧 Tone tip:**

The **third tone** (ˇ) is a **fall–then-rise** tone:

Say it like you're thinking or considering: **"zhǔ..."** — that thoughtful dip-then-rise pattern.

**📝 Common Examples:**

- 丶 (zhǔ) - "dot" (dot radical)
- 主 (zhǔ) - "master; main" (different character, same sound)
- 住 (zhù) - "to live" (different tone, fourth tone)

**💡 Memory Tip:**

Think of a small **dot** (丶) — like putting a thoughtful **period** at the end of a sentence with
that dip-and-rise **zhǔ** sound!
