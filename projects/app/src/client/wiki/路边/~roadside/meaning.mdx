| Component | Meaning                                                  |
| --------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| **路**    | Road, path - foot radical 足 + 各 (each/every direction) |
| **边**    | Side, edge, border - movement radical 辶 + 力 (strength) |

The combination literally means "road side" or "the edge area of the road."

## Mnemonic

Think of 路边 as **"the edge area where people walk alongside the road"**:

- 路 (lù) represents the road, pathway, or route for travel
- 边 (biān) represents the side, edge, or boundary area
- Together: the area that runs alongside the road
- Picture the space between the road and buildings where people walk
- Like the sidewalk, shoulder, or margin area next to streets
- The zone where road travelers can stop or walk beside the main path

This creates the image: **the edge zone that runs parallel to the main travel route**.
