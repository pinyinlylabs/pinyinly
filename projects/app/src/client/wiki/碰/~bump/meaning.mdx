## Mnemonic

Think of 碰 as **"stones coming together with a sudden impact"**:

- 石 (stone) represents hard, solid objects
- 并 (together) represents two things coming side by side suddenly
- Together: solid objects suddenly coming into contact
- Picture two rocks hitting each other and making a sharp sound
- Like accidentally bumping your head against a hard surface
- The sudden, unexpected contact between solid things

This creates the image: **the moment when two solid objects suddenly make contact**.
