**🗣️ Pronunciation of 隶 (lì)**

- **Pinyin:** lì
- **Tone: Fourth tone** — sharp **falling** tone, like giving a command

**🔤 Breakdown:**

- **l** like **"l"** in "love"
- **ì** sounds like **"ee"** in "see" but with fourth tone → sharp drop
- **lì** sounds like **"lee!"** with a sharp fall

**🎧 Tone tip:**

The **fourth tone** (ˋ) is a **sharp falling** tone:

Say it like you're giving an order to a servant: **"lì!"** — that commanding, falling tone.

- 隶书 (lì shū) - "clerical script" (a style of Chinese calligraphy)

Think of the harsh, commanding tone used to order servants - that sharp fourth tone matches the
authoritarian nature of **隶** meaning "slave/servant"!
