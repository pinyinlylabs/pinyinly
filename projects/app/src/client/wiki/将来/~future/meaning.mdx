| **将**    | General/leader - represents leading, guiding, or moving toward          |
| **来**    | Come/arrive - represents movement toward the present or arrival        |

## Mnemonic

Think of 将来 as **leading toward what's coming**:

- 将 (lead/general) + 来 (come) = "leading toward what comes"
- Like a general leading troops toward an approaching destination
- The time period that is "coming" under the "leadership" of change
- Events that are being "led" toward us from ahead

This creates the temporal concept: **the time that is approaching or being led toward us**.
