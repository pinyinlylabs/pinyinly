| Component | Meaning                                                                 |

| **西**    | West - originally a bird's nest, suggesting the setting sun's direction |
| **边**    | Side, edge, border - movement radical 辶 + 力 (strength)                |

The combination means "the side that faces west" or "the western boundary."

## Mnemonic

Think of 西边 as **"the side where the sun sets and birds return to nest"**:

- 西 (xī) represents the west direction, where the sun sets in the evening
- 边 (biān) represents a side, edge, or boundary area
- Together: the side/area that faces toward the setting sun
- Picture the side of a building that gets evening sunlight
- Like the edge of your property that faces the sunset
- The boundary area where the day ends and evening begins

This creates the image: **the boundary or area that faces toward the setting sun**.

## Cultural Context

In Chinese culture and feng shui, the 西边 (west side) is associated with the setting sun and the
end of the day. In traditional Chinese architecture, the west-facing areas often receive strong
afternoon sun, making 西边 important for planning building orientation. The west is also
symbolically associated with autumn and maturity in Chinese five-element theory.
