## Cultural Context

In Chinese culture and feng shui, the 西边 (west side) is associated with the setting sun and the
end of the day. In traditional Chinese architecture, the west-facing areas often receive strong
afternoon sun, making 西边 important for planning building orientation. The west is also
symbolically associated with autumn and maturity in Chinese five-element theory.
