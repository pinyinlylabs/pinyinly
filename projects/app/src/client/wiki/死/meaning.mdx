| Component | Meaning                                             |
| --------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| **歹**    | Evil, bad, deterioration - relates to death/decay   |
| **匕**    | Dagger, spoon - suggests something sharp or pointed |

The combination suggests the end of life or the state of no longer living.

## Mnemonic

Think of 死 as **"when life deteriorates and ends"**:

- 歹 (dāi) represents something bad, deteriorated, or gone wrong
- 匕 (bǐ) represents something sharp that can end life
- Together: the deterioration or end of life
- Picture life force leaving the body, becoming still and lifeless
- Like a flower wilting and becoming lifeless
- The moment when something alive becomes no longer living

This creates the image: **the transition from living to no longer living**.

In Chinese culture, 死 is often avoided in direct conversation due to cultural taboos around death.
Many euphemisms are used instead. However, 死 appears in many idioms and expressions where it
emphasizes extremes or completeness, such as 死记硬背 (rote memorization) or 累死了 (extremely
tired). The concept is treated with reverence and respect in traditional Chinese culture.
