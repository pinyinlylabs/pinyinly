## Cultural Context

In Chinese culture, 死 is often avoided in direct conversation due to cultural taboos around death.
Many euphemisms are used instead. However, 死 appears in many idioms and expressions where it
emphasizes extremes or completeness, such as 死记硬背 (rote memorization) or 累死了 (extremely
tired). The concept is treated with reverence and respect in traditional Chinese culture.
