| **匕**    | Dagger, spoon - suggests something sharp or pointed |

The combination suggests the end of life or the state of no longer living.

## Mnemonic

Think of 死 as **"when life deteriorates and ends"**:

- 歹 (dāi) represents something bad, deteriorated, or gone wrong
- 匕 (bǐ) represents something sharp that can end life
- Together: the deterioration or end of life
- Picture life force leaving the body, becoming still and lifeless
- Like a flower wilting and becoming lifeless
- The moment when something alive becomes no longer living

This creates the image: **the transition from living to no longer living**.

emphasizes extremes or completeness, such as 死记硬背 (rote memorization) or 累死了 (extremely
tired). The concept is treated with reverence and respect in traditional Chinese culture.
