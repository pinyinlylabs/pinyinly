| Component | Visual Description                                        |
| --------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |

## Mnemonic

Think of 不用 as **"no need to use"**:

- 不 (not) + 用 (use) = "not necessary to use"
- Like saying "you don't need to apply this tool"
- When something is unnecessary, you don't need to "use" effort or resources
- The negation of the need to employ something

This creates the meaning: **it's not necessary to do this action**.

1. **Decline politely**: 不用谢 (bù yòng xiè) - "no need to thank/you're welcome"

3. **Give permission to skip**: 不用去 (bù yòng qù) - "don't need to go"
