**🗣️ Pronunciation of 求 (qiú)**

- **Pinyin:** qiú
- **Tone: Second tone** — **rising** tone, like asking a question: **"Really?"**

**🔤 Breakdown:**

- **q** like **"ch"** in "cheese" but with more air (aspirated)
- **iú** sounds like **"yo"** in "yo-yo" with rising tone
- **qiú** sounds like **"chyo?"** with a questioning rise

**🎯 Mastering the "q" initial:**

The **q** sound is an **aspirated unvoiced consonant**:

1. **Start like "ch"** in "cheese"
2. **Add strong puff of air** — hold your hand in front of your mouth, you should feel air
3. **Keep tongue position high** — tip touches lower teeth, middle arches up
4. **Make it crisp and sharp** — not soft

**🎯 Mastering the "iu" final:**

The **iu** ending is a **diphthong** (two sounds blended):

1. **Start with "ee"** like in "see" (but very short)
2. **Glide quickly to "oo"** like in "food"
3. **Keep it quick and smooth** — don't pause between sounds
4. **End with rounded lips** for the "oo" sound

**Common mistakes:**

- ❌ "choo" without the "i" glide — needs to start with "ee" sound
- ❌ "kyoo" like English "Q" — should be more like "chyo"
- ❌ Flat tone — needs the rising, questioning tone
- ✅ "qiú" — aspirated "ch" + quick "ee-oo" glide + rising tone

**🎧 Tone tip:**

The **second tone** (ˊ) is **rising and questioning**:

Start **low and rise up** — like asking **"Really?"** or expressing surprise: **"qiú?"**

**📝 Practice words:**

- 要求 (yāo qiú) - "to request; requirement"
- 请求 (qǐng qiú) - "to request; to ask for"
- 求助 (qiú zhù) - "to ask for help"
- 追求 (zhuī qiú) - "to pursue"

**💡 Memory Tip:**

Think of **"chewing"** something while asking a question with rising tone — the "q" puffs air like
you're chewing, and the rising tone shows you're asking for something!
