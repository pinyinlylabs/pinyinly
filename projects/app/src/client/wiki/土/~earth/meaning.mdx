## Visual Breakdown

土 represents **earth/soil** through a simple pictographic design.

| Component | Visual Description                                    |
| --------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| **十**    | Cross shape (horizontal + vertical) showing structure |
| **一**    | Horizontal line at bottom representing ground level   |

The character shows the foundational structure of earth - the cross represents the stability and
structure of soil, while the base line represents the ground surface.

## Mnemonic

Think of 土 as **"the foundation cross in the ground"**:

- The top part (十) looks like a burial mound or hill structure
- The bottom line (一) represents the ground surface
- Like a cross marking a place in the earth
- The soil that provides structure and foundation for all growth
- Earth as the stable base upon which everything is built

This creates the image: **the stable earthen foundation that supports all life**.
