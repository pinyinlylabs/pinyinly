**🗣️ Pronunciation of 油 (yóu)**

- **Pinyin:** yóu
- **Tone: Second tone** — **rising** tone, like asking a question: **"Really?"**

**🔤 Breakdown:**

- **y** like **"y"** in "yes"
- **óu** sounds like **"oh"** gliding to **"oo"** with rising tone
- **yóu** sounds like **"yo?"** with a questioning rise

**🎯 Mastering the "ou" final:**

The **ou** ending is a **diphthong** (two sounds blended):

1. **Start with "oh"** like in "go" (but rounder)
2. **Glide quickly to "oo"** like in "food"
3. **Keep lips rounded** throughout the sound
4. **Make it smooth** — don't pause between the sounds

**Common mistakes:**

- ❌ "you" like English — should start more like "oh" than "uh"
- ❌ Just "yo" without the "oo" glide — needs to end with "oo" sound
- ❌ Flat tone — needs the rising, questioning tone
- ❌ Too much "w" sound — should be smooth glide, not "yow"
- ✅ "yóu" — "y" + smooth "oh-oo" glide + rising tone

**🎧 Tone tip:**

The **second tone** (ˊ) is **rising and questioning**:

Start **low and rise up** — like asking **"Oil?"** or expressing surprise: **"yóu?"**

**📝 Practice words:**

- 石油 (shí yóu) - "petroleum; oil"
- 汽油 (qì yóu) - "gasoline"
- 食用油 (shí yòng yóu) - "cooking oil"
- 油画 (yóu huà) - "oil painting"

**💡 Memory Tip:**

Think of oil flowing smoothly like the **"oh-oo"** glide, and the rising tone is like asking **"You
want oil?"** — smooth and questioning!
