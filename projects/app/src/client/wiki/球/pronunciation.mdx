**🗣️ Pronunciation of 球 (qiú)**

- **Pinyin:** qiú
- **Tone: Second tone** — **rising** tone, like a ball bouncing up

**🔤 Breakdown:**

- **q** like **"ch"** in "cheap" but with more puff of air
- **iú** sounds like **"ee-oh"** with rising tone
- **qiú** sounds like **"chee-oh"** with upward bounce

**🎯 Mastering the "q" sound:**

The **q** in Chinese is:

1. **Aspirated "ch"** — like "ch" in "cheap" but with strong puff of air
2. **Tongue tip down** — behind lower teeth, blade touches roof
3. **Sharp release** — explosive puff of air follows
4. **Test:** hold paper in front of mouth — it should flutter

**🎯 Mastering the "iú" final:**

The **iú** combines:

1. **"i"** like "ee" in "see" but brief
2. **"u"** like "oh" in "go" — rounded lips
3. **Rising tone** — starts low and climbs up
4. **Smooth glide** — "i" flows into rounded "u"

**🎧 Tone tip:**

The **second tone** (ˊ) **rises** like a bouncing ball:

Start **low and lift up** — like watching a ball bounce higher: "qiú!"
