**🗣️ Pronunciation of 七 (qī)**

- **Pinyin:** qī
- **Tone: First tone** — **high and flat** tone, like a steady note: **"Eeee"**

**🔤 Breakdown:**

- **q** — This is the tricky part! It's like **"ch"** in "cheese" but **breathier** and **sharper**
- **ī** sounds like **"ee"** in "see" but held steady and high
- **qī** sounds like a sharp **"chee"** with steady high pitch

**🎯 Mastering the "q" sound:**

The **q** in Chinese is **not** like English "q" (kw). Instead:

1. **Start with "ch"** like in "cheese"
2. **Add more breath** — make it airier and sharper
3. **Keep your tongue tip down** — don't let it touch the roof of your mouth
4. **Think of it as "ch" + extra air**

**Common mistakes:**

- ❌ "kee" (like English "key") — too hard, no breathiness
- ❌ "chee" (like "cheese") — close, but needs more air
- ✅ "qī" — sharp, breathy "ch" + "ee" sound

**🎧 Tone tip:**

The **first tone** (¯) is **high and flat**:

Keep your voice **steady and high** throughout — like humming a single high note: **"qīīī"**

**📝 Practice words:**

- 七 (qī) - "seven"
- 七月 (qī yuè) - "July"
- 七十 (qī shí) - "seventy"
- 妻子 (qī zi) - "wife"

**💡 Memory Tip:**

Think **"cheese"** but with a sharp breath of air — like blowing out a candle while saying "cheese"!
