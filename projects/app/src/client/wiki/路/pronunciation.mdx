**🗣️ Pronunciation of 路 (lù)**

- **Pinyin:** lù
- **Tone: Fourth tone** — **falling** tone, sharp and decisive

**🔤 Breakdown:**

- **l** — A clear "l" sound with tongue tip touching roof of mouth
- **ù** sounds like **"oo"** in "food" but with fourth tone → sharp fall
- **lù** sounds like **"loo"** with a definitive downward drop

**🎯 Mastering the "l" sound:**

The **l** in Chinese is similar to English:

1. **Tongue tip up** — press firmly against roof of mouth behind front teeth
2. **Clear and crisp** — like "l" in "love" or "light"
3. **Full contact** — make sure tongue tip makes solid contact
4. **Release smoothly** — flow into the vowel

**🎯 Mastering the "ù" vowel:**

The **ù** sound is a **back vowel**:

1. **Rounded lips** — like making an "oo" shape
2. **Tongue back** — pull tongue toward back of mouth
3. **Deep sound** — resonates in back of throat
4. **Pure vowel** — don't let it drift to other sounds

**Common mistakes:**

- ❌ "luh" with schwa sound — should be pure "oo"
- ❌ Rising or flat tone — must fall sharply
- ❌ Weak "l" sound — needs clear tongue contact
- ✅ "lù" — clear "l" + "oo" + sharp falling tone

**🎧 Tone tip:**

The **fourth tone** (ˋ) is **falling and authoritative**:

Start **high and drop decisively** — like giving directions: **"lù!"** (This way!)

**📝 Practice words:**

- 路 (lù) - "road; path; route"
- 路上 (lù shang) - "on the road"
- 马路 (mǎ lù) - "street; road"
- 道路 (dào lù) - "road; path; way"
- 公路 (gōng lù) - "highway; public road"
- 走路 (zǒu lù) - "to walk"
- 问路 (wèn lù) - "to ask for directions"

**💡 Memory Tip:**

路 means "road" — the **sharp falling tone** is like pointing decisively down a path: **"That
road!"**
