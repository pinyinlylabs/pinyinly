**🗣️ Pronunciation of 墙 (qiáng)**

- **Pinyin:** qiáng
- **Tone: Second tone** — **rising** tone, like asking a question: **"Qyahng?"**

**🔤 Breakdown:**

- **q** — This is unique! It's like **"ch"** but with **lips pursed** like whistling
- **iáng** sounds like **"yahng"** with rising tone and Chinese nasal ending
- **qiáng** sounds like **"chyahng"** with pursed lips and upward inflection

**🎯 Mastering the Chinese "q" sound:**

The **q** in Chinese is **very different** from English:

1. **Purse your lips** — like you're about to whistle
2. **Make "ch" sound** — tongue position like "cheese"
3. **Keep lips rounded** — maintain that whistling lip shape
4. **Add slight puff** — small burst of air

**🎯 Mastering the "iáng" final:**

The **iáng** ending combines **"i" + "áng"**:

1. **Start with "ee"** briefly
2. **Glide to "ah"** like in "father"
3. **Add "ng"** like at the end of "sing"
4. **Make it rise** — second tone goes up

**🎧 Tone tip:**

The **second tone** (ˊ) is a **rising** tone:

Start mid-level and rise up like asking **"qiáng?"** — like questioning "wall?"

**📝 Common Examples:**

- 墙 (qiáng) - "wall"
- 围墙 (wéi qiáng) - "enclosing wall"
- 墙壁 (qiáng bì) - "wall"
- 撞墙 (zhuàng qiáng) - "hit a wall"

**💡 Memory Tip:**

Think of the rising tone like your voice **climbing up** a tall **wall** — the pitch rises as you
scale higher!
