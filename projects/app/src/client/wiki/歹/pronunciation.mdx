**🗣️ Pronunciation of 歹 (dǎi)**

- **Pinyin:** dǎi
- **Tone: Third tone** — **falling-rising** tone, like saying "uh-huh" when nodding

**🔤 Breakdown:**

- **d** like **"d"** in "dog"
- **ǎi** sounds like **"eye"** with third tone → dip down and rise up
- **dǎi** sounds like **"die"** with a dip-then-rise

**🎧 Tone tip:**

The **third tone** (ˇ) is a **fall–then-rise** tone:

Say it like you're contemplating something ominous: **"dǎi..."** — that thoughtful dip-then-rise
pattern.

**📝 Common Examples:**

- 歹徒 (dǎi tú) - "bad person; criminal"
- 歹意 (dǎi yì) - "malice; ill intent"
- 好歹 (hǎo dǎi) - "good or bad; anyway"

**💡 Special Note:**

歹 is primarily used as a **radical component** in other characters and rarely appears alone in
modern Chinese. It's the "bad/evil" radical found in characters like:

- 死 (sǐ) - "die" (contains 歹)
- 残 (cán) - "cruel" (contains 歹)

**💡 Memory Tip:**

歹 represents "death/evil" — say it with that **contemplative dip-and-rise** like pondering
something dark!
