**🗣️ Pronunciation of 跟 (gēn)**

- **Pinyin:** gēn
- **Tone: First tone** — **high level** tone, steady and flat

**🔤 Breakdown:**

- **g** — An unaspirated "g" sound, softer than English "g"
- **ēn** sounds like **"un"** in "fun" but with first tone → high and steady
- **gēn** sounds like **"gun"** but flatter and at a high pitch

**🎯 Mastering the "g" sound:**

The **g** in Chinese is **unaspirated**:

1. **No puff of air** — unlike English "g" in "go"
2. **Soft and gentle** — like "g" in "big" but lighter
3. **Place tongue** at back of mouth against soft palate
4. **Release gently** — don't force it

**🎯 Mastering the "ēn" final:**

The **ēn** ending is **nasalized**:

1. **Start with "e"** like in "her" (schwa sound)
2. **Add "n"** — tongue tip touches roof of mouth
3. **Make it nasal** — sound resonates in nose
4. **Keep it short** — crisp, not drawn out

**Common mistakes:**

- ❌ "gen" with harsh English "g" — should be softer
- ❌ "gain" sound — wrong vowel, should be more like "gun"
- ❌ Missing nasal quality — needs the "n" resonance
- ✅ "gēn" — soft "g" + nasal "en" + high flat tone

**🎧 Tone tip:**

The **first tone** (¯) is **high and level**:

Keep it **steady at high pitch** — like a flat line on a high musical note: **"gēn—"**

**📝 Practice words:**

- 跟 (gēn) - "to follow; with"

**💡 Memory Tip:**

跟 means "to follow" — the **steady high tone** is like staying consistently behind someone, never
wavering!
