| Component | Visual Description                                          |
| --------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| **下**    | Down/below - shows downward movement or lower position     |
| **来**    | Come - movement toward the speaker's location              |

## Mnemonic

Think of 下来 as **"coming down to where I am"**:

- 下 shows downward direction
- 来 indicates movement toward the speaker  
- Together: someone/something moving down to your location
- Like a friend coming downstairs to meet you on a lower floor

The combination emphasizes movement toward the speaker's position at a lower level.
