**🗣️ Pronunciation of 耒 (lěi)**

- **Pinyin:** lěi
- **Tone: Third tone** — **falling-rising** tone, like saying "hmm" when thinking

**🔤 Breakdown:**

- **l** like **"l"** in "love"
- **ěi** sounds like **"ay"** in "say", but with third tone → dip down and rise up
- **lěi** sounds like **"lay"** with a contemplative dip-then-rise

**🎧 Tone tip:**

The **third tone** (ˇ) is a **fall–then-rise** tone:

Say it like you're considering an ancient farming tool: **"lěi..."** — that's the thoughtful tone
pattern of **lěi**.

**📝 Common Examples:**

- 耒 (lěi) - "plow" (ancient farming tool)
- 耒耜 (lěi sì) - "plow and spade" (traditional farming implements)

**Special Note:**

耒 is primarily seen as a **radical** in other characters related to farming and agriculture. As a
standalone character, it's quite rare in modern usage but appears in:

- Characters like 耕 (gēng) - "to plow, cultivate"
- Characters like 耘 (yún) - "to weed"

**💡 Memory Tip:**

Think of the ancient, thoughtful work of plowing fields — **lěi** carries that deep, contemplative
third tone of agricultural tradition!
