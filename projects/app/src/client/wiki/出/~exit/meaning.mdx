## Visual Breakdown

出 is a pictographic representation of something emerging or coming out.

| Component | Meaning                                       |
| --------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| **凵**    | Container/receptacle - something that holds   |
| **山**    | Mountain - something that rises/emerges       |

The combination shows something mountain-like emerging from a container - the concept of coming out.

## Mnemonic

Think of 出 as **"a mountain emerging from its container"**:

- The container (凵) represents the enclosed or hidden space
- The mountain (山) represents something rising and becoming visible
- Together: the action of emerging from concealment into view
- Picture a mountain peak rising above the treeline
- Like something breaking free from its enclosure

This creates the image: **emergence from concealment into visibility**.

In Chinese philosophy, 出 often relates to the natural progression of things emerging into their proper place and time, reflecting the dynamic nature of existence.
