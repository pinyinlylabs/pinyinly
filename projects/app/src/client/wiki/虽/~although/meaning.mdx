## Character Analysis

### 虽 (although)

虽 depicts **a hand yielding something valuable**:

- **虫** (insect/creature) represents something small but significant
- **隹** (short-tailed bird) shows something that could fly away
- Together: acknowledging something exists but not letting it prevent action
- Creates the sense of "even though this is true, but still..."

## Mnemonic

Think of 虽 as **"holding a bird that could fly away, but still moving forward"**:

- Like acknowledging an obstacle exists but choosing to proceed anyway
- Picture admitting a difficulty but not letting it stop you
- Shows the speaker recognizes a contrasting fact but continues their point
- Even though the bird might escape, you still hold it gently
