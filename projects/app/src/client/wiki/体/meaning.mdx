- 本 represents the essential, foundational structure
- Like saying "a person's essential form" or "fundamental structure"
- The body is the foundation (本) upon which a person (亻) exists
- Your body is your basic, essential foundation for all activity

This creates the image of **the fundamental physical structure of a person**.
