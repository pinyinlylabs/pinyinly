**🗣️ Pronunciation of 显 (xiǎn)**

- **Pinyin:** xiǎn
- **Tone: Third tone** — **falling-rising** tone, like saying "uh-huh" when nodding

**🔤 Breakdown:**

- **x** — This is tricky! It's like **"sh"** in "she" but **breathier** and **sharper**
- **iǎn** sounds like **"yen"** but with third tone → dip down and rise up
- **xiǎn** sounds like a breathy **"shyen"** with a dip-then-rise

**🎯 Mastering the "x" sound:**

The **x** in Chinese is **not** like English "x" (ks). Instead:

1. **Start with "sh"** like in "she"
2. **Add more breath** — make it airier and sharper
3. **Keep your tongue tip down** — don't let it touch the roof of your mouth

**📝 Common Examples:**

- 显 (xiǎn) - "evident; obvious; apparent"
- 显示 (xiǎn shì) - "to show; to display"
- 明显 (míng xiǎn) - "obvious; evident"
