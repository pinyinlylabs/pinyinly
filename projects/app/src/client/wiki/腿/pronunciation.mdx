**🗣️ Pronunciation of 腿 (tuǐ)**

- **Pinyin:** tuǐ
- **Tone: Third tone** — **falling-rising** tone, like saying "uh-huh" when nodding

**🔤 Breakdown:**

- **t** like **"t"** in "tea" (with a puff of air)
- **uǐ** sounds like **"way"**, but with third tone → dip down and rise up
- **tuǐ** sounds like **"tway"** with a distinctive dip-then-rise

**🎧 Tone tip:**

The **third tone** (ˇ) is a **fall–then-rise** tone:

Say it like you're pointing to a leg thoughtfully: **"tuǐ..."** — that's the contemplative tone
pattern of **tuǐ**.

**📝 Common Examples:**

- 腿 (tuǐ) - "leg; thigh"
- 大腿 (dà tuǐ) - "thigh"
- 小腿 (xiǎo tuǐ) - "calf; lower leg"
- 鸡腿 (jī tuǐ) - "chicken leg; drumstick"

**💡 Memory Tip:**

腿 refers to the leg, and the third tone's curved movement mirrors the bending motion of the leg
when walking or sitting!
