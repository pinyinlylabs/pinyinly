- Shows skills learned through practice and experience
- Often implies knowledge or competence gained over time
- Can indicate future possibility: "will be able to"
- Essential for discussing capabilities and talents

## Cultural Context

会 emphasizes the Chinese value of learning and skill development, showing that abilities come
through education, practice, and cultural transmission rather than just natural talent.
