**🗣️ Pronunciation of 厂 (hǎn)**

- **Pinyin:** hǎn
- **Tone: Third tone** — **falling-rising** tone, like saying "uh-huh" when nodding

**🔤 Breakdown:**

- **h** like **"h"** in "hat"
- **ǎn** sounds like **"ahn"** but with third tone → dip down and rise up
- **hǎn** sounds like **"hahn"** with a dip-then-rise

**🎧 Tone tip:**

The **third tone** (ˇ) is a **fall–then-rise** tone: Say it like you're thinking about the
landscape: **"hǎn..."** — that's the tone pattern.

**📝 Common Examples:**

- 厂 (hǎn) - "cliff; precipice"
- 山厂 (shān hǎn) - "mountain cliff"

**💡 Special Note:**

厂 as a **radical** (factory radical) in compound characters is pronounced differently. As a
standalone character meaning "cliff", it's pronounced **hǎn** (third tone). When used as the
"factory radical" in characters like 厅 (tīng), 历 (lì), the radical itself isn't pronounced
separately.

**💡 Memory Tip:**

厂 means "cliff" — when you see a cliff, you might pause **thoughtfully** (third tone) before
deciding your next move!
