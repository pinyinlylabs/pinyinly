## Mnemonic

Think of 村 as **measured clearings in the forest for villages**:

- The wood radical (木) shows this is related to forested areas
- The measure component (寸) suggests carefully planned spaces
- Like surveying and measuring forest land to create village settlements
- Villages were often built by clearing measured portions of woodland
- The combination shows organized human habitation within natural settings

This reflects how traditional Chinese villages were established by thoughtfully clearing forest areas and planning agricultural settlements in harmony with the natural environment.
