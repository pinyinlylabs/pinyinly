**🗣️ Pronunciation of 己 (jǐ)**

- **Pinyin:** jǐ
- **Tone: Third tone** — **falling-rising** tone, like saying "uh-huh" when nodding

**🔤 Breakdown:**

- **j** like **"j"** in "jeep" but **lighter** and **more forward** in the mouth
- **ǐ** sounds like **"ee"** with third tone → dip down and rise up
- **jǐ** sounds like **"jee"** with a dip-then-rise

**🎧 Tone tip:**

The **third tone** (ˇ) is a **fall–then-rise** tone:

Say it like you're pointing to yourself thoughtfully: **"jǐ..."** — that contemplative tone reflects
self-reflection.

**📝 Common Examples:**

- 己 (jǐ) - "oneself; self"
- 自己 (zì jǐ) - "oneself; myself"
- 知己 (zhī jǐ) - "close friend; confidant"
- 己方 (jǐ fāng) - "one's own side"
- 克己 (kè jǐ) - "self-restraint"

**💡 Memory Tip:**

Think of **己** as introspection — that **third tone** dip and rise shows the thoughtful process of
looking within yourself!
