**🗣️ Pronunciation of 始 (shǐ)**

- **Pinyin:** shǐ
- **Tone: Third tone** — **falling-rising** tone, like saying "uh-huh" when nodding

**🔤 Breakdown:**

- **sh** like **"sh"** in "sheep"
- **ǐ** sounds like **"ee"** in "see", but with third tone → dip down and rise up
- **shǐ** sounds like **"shee"** with a dip-then-rise

**🎧 Tone tip:**

The **third tone** (ˇ) is a **fall–then-rise** tone:

Say it like you're thinking or considering the beginning of something: **"shǐ..."** — that
thoughtful tone pattern is the **third tone**.

**📝 Common Examples:**

- 始 (shǐ) - "begin; start"
- 开始 (kāi shǐ) - "to begin; to start"
- 始终 (shǐ zhōng) - "from beginning to end; always"
- 原始 (yuán shǐ) - "primitive; original"
- 起始 (qǐ shǐ) - "starting point; beginning"

**💡 Memory Tip:**

Think of the third tone's dip-and-rise pattern like **starting** something — you dip down to gather
energy, then rise up to begin!
