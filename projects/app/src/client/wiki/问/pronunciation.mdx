**🗣️ Pronunciation of 问 (wèn)**

- **Pinyin:** wèn
- **Tone: Fourth tone** — sharp **falling** tone, like giving a command

**🔤 Breakdown:**

- **w** like **"w"** in "way"
- **èn** sounds like **"en"** in "pen" but with a sharp falling tone
- **wèn** sounds like **"when"** with a sharp drop

**🎧 Tone tip:**

The **fourth tone** (ˋ) is a **sharp falling** tone:

Start high and drop sharply: **"wèn!"** — like asking a direct question with authority.

**📝 Common Examples:**

- 问 (wèn) - "ask, question"
- 问题 (wèn tí) - "question, problem"
- 问路 (wèn lù) - "ask for directions"
- 请问 (qǐng wèn) - "excuse me, may I ask"

**📝 Special Notes:**

The character 问 contains the door radical 门, which makes sense — asking questions often involves
going through the "door" of someone's knowledge.

**💡 Memory Tip:**

When you **ask** a direct question, you use a firm, falling tone — just like **wèn**!
