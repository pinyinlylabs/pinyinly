## Visual Breakdown

井 is a pictographic character representing a water well structure.

| Component | Meaning                                          |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| **口**    | Square opening at the top of the well            |
| **十**    | Cross-beams or support structure inside the well |

The character depicts the overhead view of a traditional Chinese well with its square opening and
internal support framework.

## Mnemonic

Think of 井 as **"looking down into a structured opening"**:

- The outer square (口) represents the well's opening at ground level
- The inner cross (十) shows the wooden frame or stone structure inside
- Together: a carefully constructed access to underground water
- Picture looking down into a traditional village well
- The character resembles the view from above showing the opening and structure
- Remember: wells need structure to prevent collapse

This creates the image: **a structured opening to access hidden resources**.

## Core Meaning & Usage

井 represents **structured access to resources and orderly arrangements**. It's used for:

1. **Water wells**: 水井 (shuǐjǐng) - "water well"
2. **Oil wells**: 油井 (yóujǐng) - "oil well"
3. **Orderliness**: 井然有序 (jǐngrán yǒuxù) - "in good order"
4. **Mining**: 矿井 (kuàngjǐng) - "mine shaft"

## Examples

## Cultural Context

井 holds deep significance in Chinese civilization as the center of community life. Traditional
Chinese villages were organized around wells, which served as gathering places for social
interaction and community decision-making. The "井田制" (jǐngtián zhì) - "well-field system" - was
an ancient land distribution method where eight families farmed plots around a central well. Wells
represent life-sustaining resources and the importance of community cooperation. The phrase
"井水不犯河水" (jǐngshuǐ bù fàn héshuǐ) - "well water doesn't interfere with river water" - means
keeping separate spheres of influence and avoiding conflicts.
