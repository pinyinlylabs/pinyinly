**🗣️ Pronunciation of 尽 (jǐn)**

- **Pinyin:** jǐn
- **Tone: Third tone** — **falling-rising** tone, like thoughtfully saying "hmm..."

**🔤 Breakdown:**

- **j** like **"j"** in "jeep" but softer, more like "gee" without the "g" sound
- **ǐn** sounds like **"een"** with the falling-rising tone pattern
- **jǐn** sounds like **"jeen"** with a dip-then-rise

**🎯 Mastering the Chinese "j" sound:**

The **j** in Chinese is **different** from English:

1. **Start with "gee"** — like the letter "G"
2. **Remove the "g"** — keep only the soft "ee" part
3. **Make it whispered** — very soft, almost like a whisper
4. **Think "gee" without the "g"** — a gentle, soft sound

**🎧 Tone tip:**

The **third tone** (ˇ) is **falling then rising**:

Start **mid-level, dip down low, then rise up** — like saying "hmm..." when thinking. It's the
longest tone.

**📝 Common Examples:**

- 尽 (jǐn) - "use up; exhaust; to the utmost"
- 尽量 (jǐn liàng) - "as much as possible; try one's best"
- 尽管 (jǐn guǎn) - "although; even though"
- 尽快 (jǐn kuài) - "as soon as possible"

**📚 Note on Multiple Pronunciations:**

尽 has another pronunciation **jìn** (fourth tone) meaning "to the limit; completely":

- 尽头 (jìn tóu) - "end; extremity"
- 用尽 (yòng jìn) - "use up completely"

**💡 Memory Tip:**

The falling-rising tone mimics the effort of using something up — you start strong, dip down as
resources get low, then push to finish!
