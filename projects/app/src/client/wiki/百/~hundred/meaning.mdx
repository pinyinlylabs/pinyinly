## Visual Breakdown

百 represents **the number one hundred** through the concept of "white/pure" borrowed for its sound.

| Component | Visual Description                                  |
| --------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| **一**    | Horizontal line at top representing unity/wholeness |
| **日**    | Sun/day component (simplified from 白 "white")      |

The character originally meant "white" but was borrowed for "hundred" due to sound similarity,
representing purity and completeness.

## Mnemonic

Think of 百 as **"one pure, complete cycle"**:

- The top line (一) represents the completeness of reaching 100
- The bottom part (白-like) suggests purity and wholeness
- Like reaching a clean, round number that feels complete
- 100 represents a perfect, pure milestone in counting
- The satisfaction of completing ten full cycles of ten

This creates the image: **the pure completion of counting to one hundred**.
