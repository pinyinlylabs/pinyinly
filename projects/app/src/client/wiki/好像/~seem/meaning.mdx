| **像**    | Resemble/like - represents similarity, appearance, or resemblance |

## Mnemonic

Think of 好像 as **it looks good/right, like something**:

- 好 (good/well) + 像 (like/resemble) = "looks good, like [something]"
- Like when something appears to match your expectations well
- When appearances suggest something positive or likely
- A favorable impression that resembles reality

This creates the meaning: **it appears to be true or likely based on what you observe**.
