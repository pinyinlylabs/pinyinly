**🗣️ Pronunciation of 廾 (gǒng)**

- **Pinyin:** gǒng
- **Tone: Third tone** — **falling-rising** tone, like saying "uh-huh" when nodding

**🔤 Breakdown:**

- **g** like **"g"** in "go"
- **ǒng** sounds like **"ong"** but with third tone → dip down and rise up
- **gǒng** sounds like **"gong"** with a dip-then-rise pattern

**🎧 Tone tip:**

The **third tone** (ˇ) is a **fall–then-rise** tone:

Start mid, dip down low, then rise back up, like when you're thinking or being thoughtful. **gǒng**
should have that contemplative quality.

**📝 Common Examples:**

廾 is a **radical component** that appears in characters related to hands or holding:

- 开 (kāi) - "open" (contains 廾)
- 弄 (nòng) - "do; handle" (contains 廾)
- 异 (yì) - "different" (contains 廾)

**🔧 Special Notes:**

廾 is primarily used as a **radical** (building component) rather than as a standalone character in
modern Chinese. It represents "two hands" or the concept of "joining hands."

**💡 Memory Tip:**

廾 as the "two hands" radical uses the **gentle, joining** third tone — like two hands coming
together in a **thoughtful, cooperative** gesture!
