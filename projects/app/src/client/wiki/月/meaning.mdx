3. **For time periods**: 上个月 (shàng gè yuè) - "last month"

## As a Radical

月 is an important **radical** appearing in many characters related to:

- **Body parts**: 肚 (dù) "belly", 肺 (fèi) "lungs" (actually the "meat" radical 肉)
- **Time**: 期 (qī) "period", 朔 (shuò) "new moon"
- **Light**: 朦 (méng) "dim moonlight"

**Note**: The body parts usage comes from 肉 (meat/flesh) which looks very similar to 月!

- **Time**: 期 (qī) "period", 朔 (shuò) "new moon"
- **Light**: 朦 (méng) "dim moonlight"

> **Note:** Many body part characters, such as 肚 (dù) "belly" and 肺 (fèi) "lungs", use a radical
> that looks like 月 but is actually derived from the "meat" radical (肉). This radical is visually
> similar to 月, but its meaning and origin are different. Be careful not to confuse the two!

## Cultural Notes

月 in Chinese culture:

- **日月**: "sun and moon" (representing cosmic balance and time)
- **月圆人团圆**: "when the moon is round, families reunite" (Mid-Autumn Festival)
- Associated with yin energy (gentle, receptive, feminine)
- Central to traditional lunar calendar still used for festivals

## Cultural Festivals

- **中秋节** (Zhōngqiū Jié) - "Mid-Autumn Festival" (moon worship)

## Learning Notes

月 is essential because:

- Fundamental for all month/time vocabulary

- Important for understanding Chinese festivals and culture

月 and 日 together represent the fundamental time cycles that govern human life!
