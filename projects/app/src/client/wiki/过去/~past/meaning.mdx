## Mnemonic

Think of 过去 as **"time that has crossed over and gone away"**:

- 过 (guò) represents crossing over, passing through a point
- 去 (qù) represents going away, departing, leaving
- Together: time that has crossed the boundary and departed
- Picture time flowing like a river that has passed under a bridge
- Like watching events cross from present into memory
- The moment when "now" becomes "then" and moves away from us

This creates the image: **time flowing past us and crossing over into memory**.
