- **Pinyin:** pǐ
- **Tone: Third tone** — **falling-rising** tone, like saying "uh-huh" when nodding

- **ǐ** sounds like **"ee"** in "see", but with the **third tone** → dip down and rise up
- **pǐ** sounds like **"pee"** with a dip-then-rise

The **third tone** (ˇ) is a **fall–then-rise** tone:

Say it like you're thoughtfully considering fabric: **"pǐ..."** — that contemplative dip-then-rise
pattern.

commonly used for the same meaning.
