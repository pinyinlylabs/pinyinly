**🗣️ Pronunciation of 鬼 (guǐ)**

- **Pinyin:** guǐ
- **Tone: Third tone** — **falling-rising** tone, like saying "uh-huh" when nodding

**🔤 Breakdown:**

- **g** like **"g"** in "go"
- **uǐ** sounds like **"way"** but with third tone → dip down and rise up
- **guǐ** sounds like **"gway"** with a dip-then-rise

**🎧 Tone tip:**

The **third tone** (ˇ) is a **fall–then-rise** tone: Say it like you're telling a spooky story with
suspense: **"guǐ..."** — that's the mysterious, wavering tone pattern.

**📝 Common Examples:**

- 鬼 (guǐ) - "ghost; spirit"
- 鬼魂 (guǐ hún) - "ghost; soul"
- 魔鬼 (mó guǐ) - "devil; demon"

**💡 Memory Tip:**

Think of a **ghostly voice** that wavers **up and down** — that matches the falling-rising tone
of 鬼!
