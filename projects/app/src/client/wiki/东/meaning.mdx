## Mnemonic

Think of 东 as **watching the sunrise through trees**:

- The sun (日) rises in the east, appearing behind trees (木) on the horizon
- Early morning light filtering through forest trees facing east
- Standing in a forest and seeing the dawn break through the eastern treeline
- The combination suggests the direction where daylight first appears

This creates a vivid image: the **eastern direction is where you see the sun rise behind trees**.
