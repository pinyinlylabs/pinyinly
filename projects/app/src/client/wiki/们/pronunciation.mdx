**🔤 Breakdown:**

- **men** sounds like **"mun"** but very light and quick

**🎧 Tone tip:**

The **neutral tone** (·) is **light and unstressed**:

them plural, like adding "-s" in English but much lighter in pronunciation!

**💡 Memory Tip:**

们 creates groups — it's quick and light, just like how you'd quickly say "and others" when listing
people!
