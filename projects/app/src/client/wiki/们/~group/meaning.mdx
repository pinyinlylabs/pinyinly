## Mnemonic

Think of 们 as **people gathering at a gate**:

- The person radical (亻) shows this is about people
- The gate (门) represents a meeting place where people come together
- Like people gathering at the village gate or entrance to a building
- When you see multiple people at one gate, you know it's a group

This suffix transforms singular person words into plural groups: 我 (I) → 我们 (we), 你 (you)
→ 你们 (you all), 他 (he) → 他们 (they).
