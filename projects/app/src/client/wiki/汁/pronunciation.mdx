**🗣️ Pronunciation of 汁 (zhī)**

- **Pinyin:** zhī
- **Tone: First tone** — **high and flat** tone, like a steady note: **"zheeee"**

**🔤 Breakdown:**

- **zh** like **"j"** in "jump" but with tongue curled back (retroflex)
- **ī** sounds like **"ee"** in "see" but held steady and high
- **zhī** sounds like **"jee"** with a steady high pitch and curled tongue

**🎯 Mastering the "zh" initial:**

The **zh** sound is a **retroflex consonant**:

1. **Curl your tongue tip back** slightly toward the roof of your mouth
2. **Make a "j" sound** but with the curled tongue position
3. **Don't curl too much** — just a slight curl back
4. **Keep it crisp** — not drawn out

**Common mistakes:**

- ❌ "jee" with regular "j" — needs the retroflex tongue curl
- ❌ "chee" sound — should be voiced like "j", not unvoiced like "ch"
- ❌ Rising or falling tone — should stay high and flat
- ✅ "zhī" — curled "zh" + steady high "ee"

**🎧 Tone tip:**

The **first tone** (¯) is **high and steady**:

Start **high and stay level** — like singing a steady note: **"zhīīī"**

**📝 Practice words:**

- 果汁 (guǒ zhī) - "fruit juice"
- 汁水 (zhī shuǐ) - "juice; liquid"
- 橙汁 (chéng zhī) - "orange juice"
- 苹果汁 (píng guǒ zhī) - "apple juice"

**💡 Memory Tip:**

Think of **"juicy"** but with a curled tongue and steady high tone — imagine holding a long, steady
note while saying the "zh" sound!
