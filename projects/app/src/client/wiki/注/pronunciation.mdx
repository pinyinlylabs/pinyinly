**🗣️ Pronunciation of 注 (zhù)**

- **Pinyin:** zhù
- **Tone: Fourth tone** — sharp **falling** tone, like giving a command: **"zhù!"**

**🔤 Breakdown:**

- **zh** like **"j"** in "jump" but with tongue curled back (retroflex)
- **ù** sounds like **"oo"** in "food" with sharp falling tone
- **zhù** sounds like **"joo!"** with a sharp drop and curled tongue

**🎯 Mastering the "zh" initial:**

The **zh** sound is a **retroflex consonant**:

1. **Curl your tongue tip back** slightly toward the roof of your mouth
2. **Make a "j" sound** but with the curled tongue position
3. **Don't curl too much** — just a slight curl back
4. **Keep it voiced** — vocal cords should vibrate

**🎯 Mastering the "u" final:**

The **u** sound in Chinese is pure and rounded:

1. **Round your lips** like whistling
2. **Make "oo" sound** like in "food"
3. **Keep it pure** — don't add extra sounds
4. **Hold the rounded lip position** throughout

**Common mistakes:**

- ❌ "joo" with regular "j" — needs the retroflex tongue curl
- ❌ "choo" sound — should be voiced like "j", not unvoiced like "ch"
- ❌ Weak falling tone — should be sharp and decisive
- ❌ "juh" sound — should be clear "oo" not "uh"
- ✅ "zhù" — curled "zh" + rounded "oo" + sharp fall

**🎧 Tone tip:**

The **fourth tone** (ˋ) is **sharp and falling**:

Start **high and drop sharply** — like giving a firm command: **"zhù!"**

**📝 Practice words:**

- 注意 (zhù yì) - "to pay attention"
- 注册 (zhù cè) - "to register"
- 注入 (zhù rù) - "to pour into"
- 专注 (zhuān zhù) - "to concentrate"

**💡 Memory Tip:**

Think of someone commanding **"Focus!"** with authority — that sharp, falling tone with the curled
tongue shows concentrated attention and decisive action!
