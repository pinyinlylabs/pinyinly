## Cultural Context

人生 carries profound philosophical weight in Chinese culture, reflecting millennia of contemplation
about human existence. It encompasses Confucian ideals of moral cultivation, Daoist concepts of
harmony with nature, and Buddhist notions of impermanence. The phrase "人生如戏" (rénshēng rú xì) -
"life is like a play" - reflects the theatrical metaphor often used to discuss life's roles and
performances. In Chinese thought, 人生 is not just biological existence but the opportunity for
moral and spiritual development, making it central to discussions of purpose, meaning, and personal
fulfillment.
