- Like sparks jumping from a campfire or cooking flame
- Each dot represents a small flame or burning ember
- When you see 灬 at the bottom of a character, think "heat" or "cooking"
- Imagine looking down at a stove with four burner flames

This radical tells you the character relates to **fire, heat, cooking, or burning processes**.

## Core Meaning & Usage

灬 appears as the **bottom radical in many fire-related characters**:

1. **Cooking/food preparation**: 煮 (zhǔ) - "to boil", 蒸 (zhēng) - "to steam"
2. **Heat and temperature**: 热 (rè) - "hot", 烈 (liè) - "intense heat"
3. **Light and illumination**: 照 (zhào) - "to shine", 燃 (rán) - "to burn"
4. **Emotions (metaphorical)**: 急 (jí) - "urgent/anxious" (like burning passion)

## Examples in Characters

- **热** (rè) - "hot" (执 + 灬)
- **煮** (zhǔ) - "to boil/cook" (者 + 灬)
- **照** (zhào) - "to shine/illuminate" (昭 + 灬)
- **蒸** (zhēng) - "to steam" (承 + 灬)
- **烈** (liè) - "fierce/intense" (列 + 灬)

## Cultural Context

Fire is one of the **Five Elements** (五行) in Chinese philosophy, representing:

- **Energy and transformation**
- **Cooking and civilization**
- **Light and knowledge**
- **Passion and intensity**

The 灬 radical connects characters to these fundamental fire concepts, especially in cooking and
heating processes that are central to daily life and cultural development.
