4. **Emotions (metaphorical)**: 急 (jí) - "urgent/anxious" (like burning passion)

## Examples in Characters

- **热** (rè) - "hot" (执 + 灬)

## Cultural Context

Fire is one of the **Five Elements** (五行) in Chinese philosophy, representing:

- **Energy and transformation**
- **Cooking and civilization**
- **Light and knowledge**
- **Passion and intensity**

The 灬 radical connects characters to these fundamental fire concepts, especially in cooking and
heating processes that are central to daily life and cultural development.
