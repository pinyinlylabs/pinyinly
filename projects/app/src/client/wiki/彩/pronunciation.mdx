**🗣️ Pronunciation of 彩 (cǎi)**

- **Pinyin:** cǎi
- **Tone: Third tone** — **falling-rising** tone, like saying "uh-huh" when nodding

**🔤 Breakdown:**

- **c** like **"ts"** in "cats" - it's a sharp, crisp sound
- **ǎi** sounds like **"eye"** but with third tone → dip down and rise up
- **cǎi** sounds like **"tseye"** with a dip-then-rise

**🎧 Tone tip:**

The **third tone** (ˇ) is a **fall–then-rise** tone:

Say it like you're admiring colors thoughtfully: **"cǎi..."** — that's the contemplative tone
pattern of **cǎi**.

**📝 Common Examples:**

- 彩 (cǎi) - "color; hue"
- 彩色 (cǎi sè) - "colorful; in color"
- 精彩 (jīng cǎi) - "wonderful; brilliant"

**💡 Memory Tip:**

Think of **"tseye"** with a thoughtful dip-rise — when you see beautiful **colors**, you often pause
and admire them contemplatively, just like the third tone's pattern!
