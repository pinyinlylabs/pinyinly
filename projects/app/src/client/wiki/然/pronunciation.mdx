**🗣️ Pronunciation of 然 (rán)**

- **Pinyin:** rán
- **Tone: Second tone** — **rising** tone, like asking a question

**🔤 Breakdown:**

- **r** like **"r"** in "run" (but softer, almost like "zh" sound)
- **án** sounds like **"ahn"** with a rising tone, like saying "Yes?" when someone calls your name
- **rán** sounds like **"rahn"** with a questioning rise

**🎧 Tone tip:**

The **second tone** (´) is a **rising** tone:

Say it like you're responding "Yes?" when someone calls you — **"rán?"** — that upward questioning
inflection is the second tone pattern.

**📝 Common Examples:**

- 然 (rán) - "yes; correct"
- 然后 (rán hòu) - "then; afterwards"
- 当然 (dāng rán) - "of course"
- 突然 (tū rán) - "suddenly"

**💡 Memory Tip:**

Think of 然 as agreeing with someone by saying "Yes?" — that rising, confirmatory tone matches the
second tone perfectly!
