## Mnemonic

Think of 不错 as **"not wrong" or "not mistaken"**:

- When something is 不错, it means "not wrong" = correct/good
- Like saying "you're not wrong about that" = "you're right, it's good"
- If it's not a mistake (不错), then it must be acceptable or positive
- The absence of error indicates quality and correctness
- A modest way of saying something is good without being overly enthusiastic

This creates a **positive assessment through double negative**.
