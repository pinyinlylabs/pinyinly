**🗣️ Pronunciation of 戏 (xì)**

- **Pinyin:** xì
- **Tone: Fourth tone** — sharp **falling** tone, like announcing a show

**🔤 Breakdown:**

- **x** like **"sh"** in "she" but **lighter** and more **forward** in the mouth
- **ì** sounds like **"ee"** in "see" but with fourth tone → sharp downward drop
- **xì** sounds like **"shee!"** with a definitive falling tone

**🎯 Mastering the "x" sound:**

The **x** in Chinese is **different** from English:

1. **Start with "sh"** like in "she"
2. **Keep tongue forward** — tip behind lower teeth, not curled back
3. **Make it lighter** — more airy, less harsh than English "sh"

**🎧 Tone tip:**

The **fourth tone** (ˋ) is a **sharp falling** tone:

Say it like you're announcing "showtime!" — **"xì!"** — that dramatic drop captures the excitement
and performance aspect of theater and play.
