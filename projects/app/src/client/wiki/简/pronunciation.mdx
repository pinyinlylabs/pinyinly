**🗣️ Pronunciation of 简 (jiǎn)**

- **Pinyin:** jiǎn
- **Tone: Third tone** — **falling-rising** tone, like saying "uh-huh" when nodding

**🔤 Breakdown:**

- **j** like **"j"** in "jeep" but **lighter** and **more forward** in the mouth
- **iǎn** sounds like **"yen"** but with third tone → dip down and rise up
- **jiǎn** sounds like **"jyen"** with a dip-then-rise

**🎯 Mastering the "j" sound:**

The **j** in Chinese is **different** from English "j":

1. **Keep your tongue forward** — tip behind lower teeth
2. **Make it lighter** — less buzzy than English "j"
3. **More like "jee"** in "gee whiz" but softer

**🎧 Tone tip:**

The **third tone** (ˇ) is a **fall–then-rise** tone:

Say it like you're thinking or being thoughtful: **"jiǎn..."** — that's the tone pattern of
**jiǎn**.

**📝 Common Examples:**

- 简 (jiǎn) - "simple"
- 简单 (jiǎn dān) - "simple; easy"
- 简直 (jiǎn zhí) - "simply; really"
- 简介 (jiǎn jiè) - "brief introduction"

**💡 Memory Tip:**

Think of **简** as making things **simple** — the third tone dips down (complicated) then rises up
(simplified)!
