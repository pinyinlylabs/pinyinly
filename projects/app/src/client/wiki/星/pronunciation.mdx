**🗣️ Pronunciation of 星 (xīng)**

- **Pinyin:** xīng
- **Tone: First tone** — **high and flat** tone, like a steady note

**🔤 Breakdown:**

- **x** — This is tricky! It's like **"sh"** in "she" but **breathier** and **sharper**
- **īng** sounds like **"ing"** in "sing" but held steady and high
- **xīng** sounds like a breathy **"shing"** with a steady high pitch

**🎯 Mastering the "x" sound:**

The **x** in Chinese is **not** like English "x" (ks). Instead:

1. **Start with "sh"** like in "she"
2. **Add more breath** — make it airier and sharper
3. **Keep your tongue tip down** — don't let it touch the roof of your mouth
