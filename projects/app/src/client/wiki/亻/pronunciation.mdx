**🗣️ Pronunciation of 亻 (rén)**

- **Pinyin:** rén
- **Tone: Second tone** — **rising** tone, like asking a question

**🔤 Breakdown:**

- **r** like **"r"** in "red" (but with tongue tip curled up)
- **én** sounds like **"en"** in "pen", but with second tone → rising like a question
- **rén** sounds like **"ren?"** with a questioning rise

**📍 Special Note:**

亻 is the **radical form** of 人 (person). It appears on the left side of many characters related to
people or human actions. When used as a radical, it's still pronounced **rén** with second tone, but
it's not typically used as a standalone character in modern Chinese.

**📝 Common Examples in Characters:**

- 你 (nǐ) - "you" (亻+ 尔)
- 他 (tā) - "he" (亻+ 也)
- 什 (shén) - "what" (亻+ 十)
- 住 (zhù) - "live" (亻+ 主)

**💡 Memory Tip:**

亻 is the "standing person" radical - imagine a person standing upright, and say **"ren?"** with a
curious, rising tone!
