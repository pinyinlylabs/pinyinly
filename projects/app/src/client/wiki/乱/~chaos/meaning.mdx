## Mnemonic

Think of 乱 as **"things twisted out of their proper place"**:

- The strokes seem to cross and intersect in unexpected ways
- Nothing follows a clear, orderly pattern
- Like tangled threads or scattered papers
- Picture a room after a tornado - everything displaced
- Imagine trying to find something in a messy pile
- The frustration of disorder and lack of organization

This creates the image: **everything mixed up and out of its proper place**.

## Cultural Context

乱 carries significant cultural weight in Chinese society, which highly values order, harmony, and
proper organization. The concept extends beyond physical messiness to social and moral disorder. In
Chinese philosophy, 乱 represents the opposite of 和 (harmony), making it fundamentally undesirable.
The phrase "天下大乱" (tiānxià dàluàn) - "great chaos under heaven" - describes the worst possible
social condition. Chinese medicine also uses 乱 to describe imbalanced energy that causes illness,
emphasizing the cultural belief that order and balance are essential for health and prosperity.
