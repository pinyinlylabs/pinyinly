**单** (dān) means **single**, **alone**, or **one**.

It’s used to describe something that stands by itself — like a single item, a solo person, or an
individual thing. You'll see it in words like:

- **单人** (dān rén) — single person
- **单数** (dān shù) — odd number
- **菜单** (cài dān) — menu (a “list” of individual dishes)

It carries the idea of **simplicity**, **solitude**, or being **non-combined**.
