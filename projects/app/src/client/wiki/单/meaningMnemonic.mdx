**Decomposition:** `⿱丷⿻甲一`

- **丷** – two small strokes (like little horns)
- **甲** – armor or shell (a chestplate or beetle shell)
- **一** – one

**💡 Mnemonic**

> Imagine a **single soldier** standing alone on the battlefield.  
> He wears a **shell of armor (甲)** and is marked with a **single line (一)** for rank.  
> Above his helmet are **two decorative horns (丷)** — he looks strong but **stands alone**.

He’s the **only one left** — the **single survivor**.

**🪛 Meaning connection**

- **一** = one
- **甲** = strong individual (armor = standout)
- **丷** = distinctive horns = unique

Altogether: a uniquely marked, armored **individual** — meaning **“single”**.
