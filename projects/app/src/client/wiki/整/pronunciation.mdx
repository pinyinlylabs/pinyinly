**🗣️ Pronunciation of 整 (zhěng)**

- **Pinyin:** zhěng
- **Tone: Third tone** — **falling-rising** tone, like saying "uh-huh" when nodding

**🔤 Breakdown:**

- **zh** like **"j"** in "judge", but with tongue curled back
- **ěng** sounds like **"ung"** in "hung", but with the **third tone** → dip down and rise up
- **zhěng** sounds like **"jung"** with a dip-then-rise

**📝 Common Examples:**

- 整 (zhěng) - "whole, entire"
- 整天 (zhěng tiān) - "all day"
- 整个 (zhěng gè) - "the whole"
- 整理 (zhěng lǐ) - "organize, tidy up"
- 完整 (wán zhěng) - "complete, intact"

**💡 Memory Tip:**

The third tone's complete dip-and-rise cycle mirrors the concept of **整** - something that goes
through a complete process to become **whole**.
