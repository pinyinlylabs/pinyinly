**🗣️ Pronunciation of 豸 (zhì)**

- **Pinyin:** zhì
- **Tone: Fourth tone** — **falling** tone, like stating a fact: **"That's it!"**

**🔤 Breakdown:**

- **zh** like **"j"** in "judge" but with tongue curled back
- **ì** sounds like **"ee"** in "see" but with a sharp falling tone
- **zhì** sounds like **"jee!"** with a sharp drop and curved tongue

**🎯 Mastering the "zh" sound:**

The **zh** in Chinese is different from English:

1. **Curl your tongue back** — tip pointing toward the roof of your mouth
2. **Like "j" in "judge"** but with the curled tongue position
3. **More retroflex** — tongue further back than English "j"

**🎧 Tone tip (Fourth tone: ˋ)**

The **fourth tone** is **sharp and falling**, like making a definitive statement:

Say it like you're identifying an animal: **"zhì!"** — that decisive, downward tone is the **fourth
tone**.
