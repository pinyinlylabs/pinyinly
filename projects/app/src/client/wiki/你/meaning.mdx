| **亻**    | Person radical (人) - indicates this relates to people |
| **尔**    | You/body (尔) - classical form meaning "you"           |

## Mnemonic

Think of 你 as **"the person I'm speaking to"** or **"recognizing another person"**:

- The person radical (亻) shows this is about human relationships
- The "you" component (尔) directly indicates the person being addressed
- Like pointing to someone and acknowledging them as an individual
- Shows respect and recognition of the other person's identity

## Usage Examples

- **你是谁？** (nǐ shì shéi?) - "Who are you?"
- **你们** (nǐ men) - "you all; you (plural)"
- **你的** (nǐ de) - "your; yours"

- Essential for greetings, questions, and conversations
