**🔤 Breakdown:**

- **d** like **"d"** in "dog"

- **dì** sounds like **"dee!"** with a sharp falling command

**🎧 Tone tip:**

The **fourth tone** (ˋ) is a **sharp falling** tone:

Start high and drop sharply: **"dì!"** — like announcing a definitive ranking.

**💡 Special Notes:**

第 is never used alone — it's always followed by a number to create ordinal numbers (first, second,
third, etc.).

**💡 Memory Tip:**

Think of **"dee!"** as announcing a definitive position — the sharp fourth tone emphasizes the
precision of ordinal numbers!
