| Component | Visual Description                                       |

| **目**    | Eye (目) - represents the organ that closes during sleep |
| **垂**    | Droop/hang down (垂) - shows things drooping or falling  |

## Mnemonic

Think of 睡 as **eyes drooping and closing for sleep**:

- The eye component (目) represents the eyes that must close for sleep
- The drooping component (垂) shows eyelids getting heavy and drooping
- Like when you're tired and your eyelids start to droop before sleep
- Shows the natural process of eyes closing as consciousness fades
- Combines the visual organ with the physical action of falling asleep

This creates the image: **heavy eyelids drooping as sleep approaches**.
