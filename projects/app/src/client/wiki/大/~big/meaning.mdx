| Component | Visual Description |
| --------- | ------------------ |
| **大**    | A person (人) with arms stretched out horizontally (一) |

## Mnemonic

Think of 大 as **a person standing with arms stretched out wide**:
- Like someone showing "this big!" with their arms
- A person standing in a heroic pose
- Someone taking up maximum space
- The classic "star" pose people make to show size

The character literally looks like 人 (person) but with an extra horizontal stroke for the outstretched arms, making the person appear larger and more imposing.

1. **Physical size**: 大房子 (dà fángzi) - "big house"
2. **Age/maturity**: 大人 (dàrén) - "adult"
3. **Importance**: 大事 (dàshì) - "important matter"

## Cultural Notes

大 carries cultural weight in Chinese:
- **大中华**: "Greater China"

## Learning Notes

大 is crucial because:
- Fundamental adjective for size and importance
- Appears in countless compound words
- Essential for comparisons and descriptions
- Teaches the concept of character evolution (人 → 大)
- Shows how radicals combine to create new meanings

The progression from 人 (person) to 大 (big person) demonstrates how Chinese characters build meaning through visual logic!
