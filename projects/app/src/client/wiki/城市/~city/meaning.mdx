Think of 城市 as **"walled market" or "fortified trading center"**:

- 城 (chéng) represents the defensive walls that protected ancient cities
- 市 (shì) represents the marketplace at the heart of urban life
- Together they capture the essence of cities: protected spaces for trade and community
- Like ancient cities that grew around fortified marketplaces

This reflects how traditional Chinese cities developed around commercial centers with protective
walls.
