**🗣️ Pronunciation of 象 (xiàng)**

- **Pinyin:** xiàng
- **Tone: Fourth tone** — **falling** tone, like stating a fact: **"That's it!"**

**🔤 Breakdown:**

- **x** — This is tricky! It's like **"sh"** in "she" but **breathier** and **sharper**
- **iàng** sounds like **"yang"** in "yang" but with a sharp falling tone
- **xiàng** sounds like a breathy **"shyang!"** with a sharp drop

**🎯 Mastering the "x" sound:**

The **x** in Chinese is **not** like English "x" (ks). Instead:

1. **Start with "sh"** like in "she"
2. **Add more breath** — make it airier and sharper
3. **Keep your tongue tip down** — don't let it touch the roof of your mouth

**🎧 Tone tip (Fourth tone: ˋ)**

The **fourth tone** is **sharp and falling**, like making a definitive statement:

Say it like you're pointing out an elephant: **"xiàng!"** — that decisive, downward tone is the
**fourth tone**.
