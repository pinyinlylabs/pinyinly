## Mnemonic

Think of 我 as **"hand holding a spear" or "I defend myself"**:

- The hand radical (扌) shows personal agency and action
- The spear component (戈) represents strength and self-defense
- Like saying "I can defend myself" or "this is my territory"
- The combination suggests confident self-identity and personal power

This reflects the assertive nature of declaring oneself - taking a strong stance about one's
identity.
