**🗣️ Pronunciation of 说 (shuō)**

- **Pinyin:** shuō
- **Tone: First tone** — **high and flat** tone, like a steady note: **"Eeee"**

**🔤 Breakdown:**

- **sh** like **"sh"** in "shoe" but with your **tongue curled back** further toward the roof of the
  mouth
- **uō** sounds like **"woh"** but shorter — almost like "whoa" without the "a"
- **shuō** sounds like **"shwoh"** with steady high pitch

**🎯 Mastering the "sh" sound:**

The **sh** in Chinese is **different** from English "sh":

1. **Curl your tongue back** — tip pointing toward the roof of your mouth
2. **Keep tongue sides touching** your upper teeth
3. **Make it deeper** — more throaty than English "sh"
4. **Think retroflex** — tongue curled back like you're making an "r" shape but saying "sh"

**🎯 Mastering the "uō" final:**

The **uō** ending is tricky:

1. **Start with "oo"** like in "food"
2. **Quickly shift to "oh"** like in "no"
3. **Keep it short** — don't drag it out
4. **Round your lips** throughout

**Common mistakes:**

- ❌ "shoo" (like English "shoe") — missing the "oh" ending
- ❌ "shwoh" with flat tone — needs high, steady tone
- ✅ "shuō" — retroflex "sh" + quick "oo-oh" + high flat tone

**🎧 Tone tip:**

The **first tone** (¯) is **high and flat**:

Keep your voice **steady and high** throughout — like announcing something important: **"shuōōō"**

**📝 Practice words:**

- 说 (shuō) - "say; speak"
- 说话 (shuō huà) - "speak; talk"
- 说明 (shuō míng) - "explain"
- 小说 (xiǎo shuō) - "novel"

**💡 Memory Tip:**

Think **"shoe"** but curl your tongue way back and add a quick "whoa!" at the end — like you're
surprised by how far back your tongue goes!
