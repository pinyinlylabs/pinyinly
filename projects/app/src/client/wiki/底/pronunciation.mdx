**🗣️ Pronunciation of 底 (dǐ)**

- **Pinyin:** dǐ
- **Tone: Third tone** — **falling-rising** tone, like saying "uh-huh" when nodding

**🔤 Breakdown:**

- **d** like **"d"** in "dog"
- **ǐ** sounds like **"ee"** in "see" but with third tone → dip down and rise up
- **dǐ** sounds like **"dee"** with a dip-then-rise pattern

**🎧 Tone tip:**

The **third tone** (ˇ) is a **fall–then-rise** tone:

Start mid, dip down low, then rise back up, like when you're thinking or being thoughtful. **dǐ**
should have that contemplative quality.

**📝 Common Examples:**

- 底下 (dǐ xia) - "bottom; underneath"
- 海底 (hǎi dǐ) - "seabed; ocean floor"
- 到底 (dào dǐ) - "after all; in the end"
- 底部 (dǐ bù) - "bottom part; base"

**💡 Memory Tip:**

底 means "bottom" — the **dipping motion** of the third tone mimics going **down to the bottom** and
coming back up!
