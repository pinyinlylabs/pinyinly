| Component | Visual Description                                               |

| **宀**    | Slanted roof lines with a central ridge, like a traditional roof |

## Mnemonic

Think of 宀 as **the outline of a rooftop with a chimney**:

- The curved top line represents the main roof ridge
- The slanted sides show the roof's slope for rain runoff
- The small vertical line in the middle looks like a chimney
- Like looking at a simple house from the side and seeing just the roofline
- The basic shelter structure that protects what's underneath

This creates the image of **fundamental overhead protection and shelter**.

3. **Containers**: 宝 (bǎo) - "treasure" (precious things kept under roof)
4. **Shelter concepts**: 安 (ān) - "peaceful/safe" (woman under roof)
