## Visual Breakdown

| Component | Visual Description                                               |
| --------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **宀**    | Slanted roof lines with a central ridge, like a traditional roof |

## Mnemonic

Think of 宀 as **the outline of a rooftop with a chimney**:

- The curved top line represents the main roof ridge
- The slanted sides show the roof's slope for rain runoff
- The small vertical line in the middle looks like a chimney
- Like looking at a simple house from the side and seeing just the roofline
- The basic shelter structure that protects what's underneath

This creates the image of **fundamental overhead protection and shelter**.

## Core Meaning & Usage

宀 appears as the **top radical in many building and shelter-related characters**:

1. **Buildings**: 家 (jiā) - "home", 房 (fáng) - "room/house"
2. **Indoor spaces**: 室 (shì) - "room", 宿 (sù) - "lodge/stay overnight"
3. **Containers**: 宝 (bǎo) - "treasure" (precious things kept under roof)
4. **Shelter concepts**: 安 (ān) - "peaceful/safe" (woman under roof)

## Examples in Characters

- **家** (jiā) - "home; family" (宀 + 豕 pig - animals under roof)
- **房** (fáng) - "room; house" (宀 + 方 square space)

- **室** (shì) - "room; chamber" (宀 + 至 arrival at shelter)
