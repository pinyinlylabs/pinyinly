## Visual Breakdown

好 uses the same **woman + child** structure but with different pronunciation and meaning.

| Component | Visual Description                                 |
| --------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| **女**    | Woman (女) - represents affection, caring feelings |
| **子**    | Child (子) - represents the object of affection    |

## Mnemonic

Think of 好 (hǎo) as **"the way a woman feels about her child"** - deep affection and preference:

- Same visual and pronunciation as 好 (hǎo) "good" but with a different meaning focus
- The woman's natural love and preference for her child
- Shows strong positive feelings and attachment
- Like having a favorite or preferred choice
- The emotional bond that makes you want to be near something

This demonstrates how the same character with the same pronunciation can have related but distinct
meanings through context.

## Usage Examples

Note: While 好 as "to like" is pronounced hǎo (third tone), it appears in compound words where it
may be pronounced hào (fourth tone):

- **好奇** (hào qí) - "curious; inquisitive"
- **爱好** (ài hào) - "hobby; interest; what one likes"
- **好学** (hào xué) - "studious; eager to learn"
- **癖好** (pǐ hào) - "quirk; personal preference"

## Grammar Note

This meaning of 好 (hǎo/hào) appears primarily in compound words rather than standalone. It forms
part of words that describe preferences, interests, and tendencies, reflecting deeper character
traits and inclinations. The pronunciation may vary between hǎo and hào depending on the specific
compound.
