## Visual Breakdown

好 uses the same **woman + child** structure but with different pronunciation and meaning.

## Mnemonic

Think of 好 (hào) as **"the way a woman feels about her child"** - deep affection and preference:

- The woman's natural love and preference for her child

This demonstrates how the same character can have related but distinct meanings through different
pronunciations.
