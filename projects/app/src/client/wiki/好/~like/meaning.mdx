## Visual Breakdown

好 uses the same **woman + child** structure with the same pronunciation but different meaning.

| Component | Visual Description                                 |
| --------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| **女**    | Woman (女) - represents affection, caring feelings |
| **子**    | Child (子) - represents the object of affection    |

## Mnemonic

Think of 好 (hǎo) as **"the way a woman feels about her child"** - deep affection and preference:

- Same visual as 好 (hǎo) "good" but represents a different meaning
- The woman's natural love and preference for her child
- Shows strong positive feelings and attachment
- Like having a favorite or preferred choice
- The emotional bond that makes you want to be near something

This demonstrates how the same character with the same pronunciation can have related but distinct
meanings depending on context.

## Usage Examples

Note: In compound words expressing preference/fondness, 好 is often pronounced with fourth tone
(hào):

- **好奇** (hào qí) - "curious; inquisitive"
- **爱好** (ài hào) - "hobby; interest; what one likes"
- **好学** (hào xué) - "studious; eager to learn"
- **癖好** (pǐ hào) - "quirk; personal preference"

## Grammar Note

This meaning of 好 (hǎo) is primarily used in compound words rather than standalone. It forms part
of words that describe preferences, interests, and tendencies, reflecting deeper character traits
and inclinations. When used in this sense, it typically appears with other characters to form words
related to personal interests and preferences.
