**🗣️ Pronunciation of 语 (yǔ)**

- **Pinyin:** yǔ
- **Tone: Third tone** — **dipping** tone, like a disappointed sigh: **"yuu~"**

**🔤 Breakdown:**

- **y** like **"y"** in "yes" — start with your tongue high and forward
- **ǔ** sounds like **"oo"** in "book" but with a dipping tone
- **yǔ** sounds like **"yuu~"** with a low dip in the middle

**🔊 Key Sound Tips:**

The **y** in Chinese:

1. **Tongue position high** — like you're about to say "ee" but then transition to "oo"
2. **Quick transition** — don't linger on the "y" sound
3. **Flow smoothly** — move from "y" to "ǔ" in one fluid motion

**🎧 Tone tip:**

The **third tone** (ˇ) is a **dipping** tone:

Start **mid-level, dip down low, then rise back up** like a valley: **"yǔ~"**

In normal speech, it often sounds like just a **low tone** without the final rise.

**📝 Common Examples:**

- 语 (yǔ) - "language; speech"
- 语言 (yǔ yán) - "language"
- 英语 (yīng yǔ) - "English language"
- 汉语 (hàn yǔ) - "Chinese language"

**💡 Memory Tip:**

Think **"you~"** with that dipping tone — like sadly asking "you... speak this language?" with a
disappointed dip in your voice!
