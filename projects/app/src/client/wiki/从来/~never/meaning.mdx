## Character Analysis

### 从 (from)

从 shows **consistent path from origin**:

- **人** (person) + **人** (person) moving together
- When with negatives, emphasizes "not even once" throughout time
- Shows examination of complete historical record

### 来 (come)

来 depicts **continuous arrival to present**:

- **木** (plant) + **人** (person) shows natural progression
- With negatives, emphasizes "never reached this point"
- Shows the complete span of time being considered

## Mnemonic

Think of 从来 + negative as **"searching the entire timeline and finding zero instances"**:

- 从 (from) starts the search at the very beginning
- 来 (come) searches all the way to now
- Adding 不 or 没 creates "never found even one case"
- Like checking every page of history and finding no examples

- **Absolute statements**: Stronger than simple negatives - emphasizes completeness
