## Visual Breakdown

时间 combines temporal measurement with space:

| Component | Visual Description                                               |
| --------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **时**    | Time/season - represents temporal divisions and specific moments |
| **间**    | Space/interval - represents gaps, spaces, and intervals between  |

## Mnemonic

Think of 时间 as **the space between moments**:

- 时 (time/moment) + 间 (space/interval) = "the space that time occupies"
- Like the gaps between clock ticks, creating duration
- The interval that exists between past and future
- How we measure the "space" that events take up

This creates the comprehensive concept: **the measurable dimension in which events occur**.
