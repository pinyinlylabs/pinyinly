| Component | Meaning                                           |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| **阝**    | Hill/mound radical (left side) - terrain/movement |
| **有**    | Have; possess; there is                          |

The combination suggests having or possessing movement that follows terrain - thus "following."

## Mnemonic

Think of 随 as **"having movement that follows the terrain"**:

- The hill radical (阝) represents the path or direction
- 有 (yǒu) shows possession or having something
- Together: having movement that adapts to follow the landscape
- Picture walking along a hillside, following its natural contours
- Like water flowing along the terrain it encounters

This creates the image: **movement that adapts to follow natural paths**.

## Core Meaning & Usage

随 represents **going along with or adapting to circumstances**:

1. **Following**: "随着" (suí zhe) - "along with; following"
2. **Compliance**: "随便" (suí biàn) - "casual; whatever; as you like"
3. **Timing**: "随时" (suí shí) - "at any time; whenever"
4. **Accompanying**: "随身" (suí shēn) - "carry with oneself"

## Examples

- **随便** (suí biàn) - "casual; whatever; as you please"
- **随时** (suí shí) - "at any time; anytime"
- **随着** (suí zhe) - "along with; as; following"
- **随身** (suí shēn) - "carry with one; portable"
- **随机** (suí jī) - "random; arbitrary"

## Cultural Context

随 embodies a key Chinese philosophical concept of adaptation and flowing with circumstances rather than fighting against them. This reflects Taoist principles of wu wei (無為) - acting in accordance with natural flow. Being 随 (adaptable and compliant) is often seen as wisdom rather than weakness in Chinese culture.
