## Mnemonic

Think of 想到 as **thoughts arriving at your mind**:

- 想 (think) + 到 (arrive) = "thinking that arrives/reaches completion"
- Like when an idea suddenly "arrives" in your consciousness
- Thoughts that successfully "reach" your awareness
- Mental processes that "arrive" at a specific memory or realization

This creates the meaning: **when thoughts successfully reach consciousness or awareness**.
