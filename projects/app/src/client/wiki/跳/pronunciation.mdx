**🗣️ Pronunciation of 跳 (tiào)**

- **Pinyin:** tiào
- **Tone: Fourth tone** — **falling** tone, sharp and decisive

**🔤 Breakdown:**

- **t** — An aspirated "t" sound with a strong puff of air
- **i** — A short "ee" sound like in "see"
- **ào** — Sounds like "ow" in "cow" with fourth tone → sharp fall
- **tiào** — Like "tee-ow" compressed together with falling tone

**🎯 Mastering the "t" sound:**

The **t** in Chinese is **aspirated**:

1. **Strong puff of air** — hold hand in front of mouth, should feel air
2. **Tongue tip contact** — press firmly against roof of mouth
3. **Explosive release** — like "t" in "top" or "tea"
4. **Crisp and clear** — more forceful than English "t" in "stop"

**🎯 Mastering the "iào" combination:**

This is a **triphthong** (three vowel sounds):

1. **Start with "i"** — short "ee" sound, tongue high and forward
2. **Glide to "a"** — open mouth, tongue drops
3. **End with "o"** — round lips for "oh" sound
4. **Make it smooth** — all three sounds flow together
5. **Add fourth tone** — whole combination falls sharply

**Common mistakes:**

- ❌ "tiao" without aspiration — needs the puff of air
- ❌ Separating sounds "tee-ah-oh" — should flow together
- ❌ Wrong tone — must fall sharply from high to low
- ✅ "tiào" — aspirated "t" + smooth "i-a-o" + falling tone

**🎧 Tone tip:**

The **fourth tone** (ˋ) is **falling and explosive**:

Start **high and drop decisively** — like the energy of jumping up then landing: **"tiào!"**
