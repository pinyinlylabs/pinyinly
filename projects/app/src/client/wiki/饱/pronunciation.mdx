**🗣️ Pronunciation of 饱 (bǎo)**

- **Pinyin:** bǎo
- **Tone: Third tone** — **falling-rising** tone, like saying "uh-huh" when nodding thoughtfully

**🔤 Breakdown:**

- **b** like **"b"** in "boy"
- **ǎo** sounds like **"ow"** in "cow" but with the third tone → dip down and rise up
- **bǎo** sounds like **"bow"** with a dip-then-rise pattern

**🎧 Tone tip:**

The **third tone** (ˇ) is a **fall–then-rise** tone. Start middle, dip down low, then rise back up -
like you're thinking carefully about something.

**📝 Common Examples:**

- 饱 (bǎo) - "full (from eating)"
- 吃饱 (chī bǎo) - "to eat one's fill"
- 饱和 (bǎo hé) - "saturated"
- 温饱 (wēn bǎo) - "food and clothing (basic needs)"
- 饱满 (bǎo mǎn) - "full, plump"

**💡 Memory Tip:**

When you're really full after a big meal and someone asks if you want more, you might thoughtfully
say "mmmm..." with that same dip-and-rise tone as **bǎo**.
