**🗣️ Pronunciation of 黍 (shǔ)**

- **Pinyin:** shǔ
- **Tone: Third tone** — **falling-rising** tone, like saying "uh-huh" when nodding

**🔤 Breakdown:**

- **sh** like **"sh"** in "shoe"
- **ǔ** sounds like **"oo"** in "book" but with third tone → dip down and rise up
- **shǔ** sounds like **"shoo"** with a dip-then-rise

**🎧 Tone tip:**

The **third tone** (ˇ) is a **fall–then-rise** tone:

Say it like you're thoughtfully considering millet grain: **"shǔ..."** — that contemplative tone
pattern.

**📝 Common Examples:**

- 黍 (shǔ) - "millet"
- 黍米 (shǔ mǐ) - "millet grain"
- 稷黍 (jì shǔ) - "millet and sorghum" (classical)
- 黍子 (shǔ zi) - "millet seeds"

**💡 Memory Tip:**

黍 sounds like "shoo" with a falling-rising tone — imagine gently shooing birds away from your
millet crop: **"shǔ"** (go away, but not too harshly) with that dipping tone.
