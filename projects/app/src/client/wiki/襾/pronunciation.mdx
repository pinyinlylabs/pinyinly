**🗣️ Pronunciation of 襾 (yà)**

- **Pinyin:** yà
- **Tone: Fourth tone** — sharp **falling** tone, like giving a command

**🔤 Breakdown:**

- **y** like **"y"** in "yes"
- **à** sounds like **"ah"** but with sharp falling tone
- **yà** sounds like **"yah!"** with a sharp drop in pitch

**📝 Common Examples:**

- 襾 (yà) - "cover; radical meaning 'cover'"

**📝 Note on Usage:**

襾 is primarily used as a radical component in other Chinese characters rather than as a standalone
word. It appears in characters like:

- 要 (yào) - "want; need"
- 覆 (fù) - "cover; overturn"

As a radical, it represents the concept of "covering" or "protection from above."

**💡 Memory Tip:**

The sharp falling fourth tone mimics the action of something falling down to cover - like a blanket
dropping sharply to cover you!
