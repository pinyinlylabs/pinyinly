**🗣️ Pronunciation of 怪 (guài)**

- **Pinyin:** guài
- **Tone: Fourth tone** — sharp **falling** tone, like giving a command

**🔤 Breakdown:**

- **g** like **"g"** in "go" but softer
- **uài** sounds like **"why"** but with fourth tone → sharp drop
- **guài** sounds like **"gwhy!"** with a sharp falling tone

**🎯 Mastering the "g" sound:**

The **g** in Chinese is **unaspirated** (no puff of air):

1. **Start with "g"** like in "go"
2. **Keep it soft** — no puff of air like "k"
3. **Make it gentle** — lighter than English "g"
4. **Think soft "g"** — let it flow smoothly

**🎯 Mastering the "uài" final:**

The **uài** sound is a **triphthong** (three vowel sounds):

1. **Start with "u"** like "oo" in "food"
2. **Glide to "a"** like "ah" in "father"
3. **End with "i"** like "ee" in "see"
4. **Blend smoothly** — "oo-ah-ee" in one fluid motion

**🎧 Tone tip:**

The **fourth tone** (ˋ) is a sharp **falling** tone:

Say it like you're expressing surprise at something odd: **"guài!"** — that sharp drop captures the
feeling of encountering something strange.

**📝 Common Examples:**

- 怪 (guài) - "strange; odd; weird; blame"
- 奇怪 (qí guài) - "strange; odd"
- 怪人 (guài rén) - "strange person; weirdo"
- 怪物 (guài wù) - "monster; freak"
- 不怪 (bù guài) - "no wonder; not surprising"

**💡 Memory Tip:**

The sharp falling **guài!** sounds like someone exclaiming "That's weird!" when they see something
strange — perfect match for the meaning!
