## Mnemonic

Think of 火 as **flames dancing upward**:

- The diagonal strokes represent flames leaping upward and outward

- The tip points upward showing fire's natural tendency to rise

Visualize a bonfire - the flames start from a central point and spread upward and outward, just like
the character 火.
