**🗣️ Pronunciation of 本 (běn)**

- **Pinyin:** běn
- **Tone: Third tone** — **falling-rising** tone, like saying "uh-huh" when nodding

**🔤 Breakdown:**

- **b** like **"b"** in "book"
- **ěn** sounds like **"un"** in "fun", but with third tone → dip down and rise up
- **běn** sounds like **"bun"** with a dip-then-rise

**🎧 Tone tip:**

The **third tone** (ˇ) is a **fall–then-rise** tone:

Say it like you're thoughtfully considering: **"běn..."** — that contemplative dip and rise is the
third tone pattern.

of reading and learning from books!
