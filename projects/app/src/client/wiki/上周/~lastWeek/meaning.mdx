| Component | Visual Description                                          |
| --------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| **上**    | Up/previous - shows movement to earlier position           |
| **周**    | Week/cycle - represents a complete seven-day period        |

## Mnemonic

Think of 上周 as **"the week that came before (上) this one"**:

- 上 shows progression to the previous position in sequence
- 周 represents the weekly cycle
- Together: the week that preceded the current week
- Like moving up a calendar to the earlier week

The concept captures temporal reference to the immediate past.

## Usage Examples

- **上周一** (shàng zhōu yī) - "last Monday"
- **上周的事** (shàng zhōu de shì) - "last week's matter"
- **上周末** (shàng zhōu mò) - "last weekend"
- **上周见过他** (shàng zhōu jiàn guò tā) - "saw him last week"

## Time Sequence Pattern

上周 fits into the complete time reference system:

- **上上周** (shàng shàng zhōu) - the week before last
- **上周** (shàng zhōu) - last week
- **这周** (zhè zhōu) - this week  
- **下周** (xià zhōu) - next week

## Grammar Patterns

上周 functions as a **time noun**:

- **上周 + [verb] + 了**: [verb] + last week (completed action)
- **上周的 + [noun]**: last week's + [noun]
- **在上周**: during last week
- **上周 + [specific day]**: last + [day of week]

## Directional Time Logic

Chinese uses spatial directions for time:

- **上** (up) = **previous/earlier** (like moving up on a timeline)
- **下** (down) = **next/later** (like moving down on a timeline)
- This creates intuitive temporal navigation

## Cultural Context

上周 reflects Chinese temporal thinking:
- **Reference point clarity**: Precisely locating events in recent past
- **Memory organization**: Helps structure recent experiences
- **Planning continuity**: Connects past events to current and future plans
- **Social accountability**: Important for following up on commitments made
