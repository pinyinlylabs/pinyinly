**🗣️ Pronunciation of 瓜 (guā)**

- **Pinyin:** guā
- **Tone: First tone** — **high and flat** tone, like stating a fact

**🔤 Breakdown:**

- **g** like **"g"** in "go" but softer, less puff of air
- **uā** sounds like **"wah"** held steady and high
- **guā** sounds like **"gwah"** with level, clear tone

**🎯 Mastering the "g" sound:**

The **g** in Chinese is:

1. **Softer than English** — less puff of air than English "g"
2. **Back of tongue** — touches soft palate (velum)
3. **Not aspirated** — no burst of air follows
4. **Voiced** — vocal cords vibrate throughout

**🎯 Mastering the "uā" final:**

The **uā** combines:

1. **"u"** like "oo" in "boot" but very brief — almost like "w"
2. **"a"** like "ah" in "father" — open and clear
3. **First tone** — stays high and level throughout
4. **Smooth glide** — "u" quickly transitions to "a"

**🎧 Tone tip:**

The **first tone** (ˉ) is **high and steady**:

Keep it **level and sustained** — like clearly stating "guā!" (It's a melon!)

**📝 Practice words:**

- 瓜 (guā) - "melon; gourd"
- 西瓜 (xī guā) - "watermelon"

Think of biting into a fresh **melon** — "guā!" with that clear, satisfied first tone expresses the
simple pleasure of tasting something sweet and refreshing.
