**🗣️ Pronunciation of 哪 (nǎ)**

- **Pinyin:** nǎ
- **Tone: Third tone** — **falling-rising** tone, like saying "uh-huh" when nodding

**🔤 Breakdown:**

- **n** like **"n"** in "no"
- **ǎ** sounds like **"ah"** in "father", but with third tone → dip down and rise up
- **nǎ** sounds like **"nah"** with a dip-then-rise

**🎧 Tone tip:**

The **third tone** (ˇ) is a **fall–then-rise** tone:

Say it like you're questioning or wondering: **"nǎ..."** — that questioning tone fits perfectly with
"which?"

**📝 Common Examples:**

- 哪 (nǎ) - "which"
- 哪个 (nǎ ge) - "which one"
- 哪里 (nǎ lǐ) - "where"
- 哪儿 (nǎr) - "where" (Beijing dialect)
- 哪些 (nǎ xiē) - "which ones"

**💡 Memory Tip:**

The **mouth radical (口)** plus **那** — when you ask **"which"** with your mouth, you're pointing
and questioning, creating that rising-falling tone pattern!
