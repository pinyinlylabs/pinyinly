| Component | Visual Description                                             |
| --------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |

## Mnemonic

Think of 去 as **leaving the ground to go somewhere private**:

- The earth component (土) shows your starting point on solid ground
- The private component (厶) suggests moving away to your own destination
- Like leaving your home ground to go to your own private place
- The character suggests **departure from a known place**
- Shows the action of moving away from where you currently are

This creates the image: **stepping away from your current ground to go elsewhere**.
