**🗣️ Pronunciation of 去 (qù)**

- **Pinyin:** qù
- **Tone: Fourth tone** — **falling** tone, like giving a command: **"Go!"**

**🔤 Breakdown:**

- **q** — Like **"ch"** in "cheese" but **breathier** and **sharper** (same as in 七)
- **ù** sounds like **"oo"** in "food" but with falling tone
- **qù** sounds like a sharp **"choo"** that drops in pitch

**🎯 Mastering the "q" sound:**

The **q** in Chinese is **not** like English "q" (kw). Instead:

1. **Start with "ch"** like in "cheese"
2. **Add more breath** — make it airier and sharper
3. **Keep your tongue tip down** — don't let it touch the roof of your mouth
4. **Think of it as "ch" + extra puff of air**

**🎯 Mastering the "ù" final:**

The **ù** ending with fourth tone:

1. **Start with "oo"** like in "food"
2. **Drop your pitch sharply** — like giving a firm command
3. **Keep lips rounded** throughout
4. **Make it decisive** — no hesitation

**Common mistakes:**

- ❌ "koo" (like "coo") — too soft, needs the breathy "q" sound
- ❌ "choo" with flat tone — needs sharp falling tone
- ❌ "qoo" with rising tone — should fall, not rise
- ✅ "qù" — breathy "ch" + "oo" + sharp falling tone

**🎧 Tone tip:**

The **fourth tone** (ˋ) is **sharp and falling**:

Start **high and drop quickly** — like giving a firm command or saying "No!" emphatically: **"qù!"**

**📝 Practice words:**

- 去 (qù) - "go"
- 过去 (guò qù) - "past; go over"
- 回去 (huí qù) - "go back"
- 上去 (shàng qù) - "go up"

**💡 Memory Tip:**

Think **"choo-choo"** train but with extra breath and a commanding tone — like telling the train
"GO!" with authority!
