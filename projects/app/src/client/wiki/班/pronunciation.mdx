**🗣️ Pronunciation of 班 (bān)**

- **Pinyin:** bān
- **Tone: First tone** — **high and flat** tone, like a steady announcement

**🔤 Breakdown:**

- **b** like **"b"** in "bat" but softer, almost like "p"
- **ān** sounds like **"ahn"** held steady and high
- **bān** sounds like **"bahn"** with level, authoritative tone

**🎯 Mastering the "b" sound:**

The **b** in Chinese is:

1. **Softer than English** — less puff of air than English "b"
2. **Almost like "p"** — but voiced, not breathy
3. **Gentle lip closure** — lips come together lightly
4. **No aspiration** — no burst of air follows

**🎯 Mastering the "ān" final:**

The **ān** combines:

1. **"a"** like "ah" in "father" — clear and open
2. **"n"** with tongue tip touching upper teeth/gums
3. **First tone** — stays high and level throughout
4. **Forward "n"** — tongue stays forward, not back like "ng"

**🎧 Tone tip:**

The **first tone** (ˉ) is **high and steady**:

Keep it **level and sustained** — like announcing "bān!" (Class begins!)

**📝 Practice words:**

- 班 (bān) - "class; shift; team"
- 班级 (bān jí) - "class; grade level"
- 班长 (bān zhǎng) - "class monitor"
- 上班 (shàng bān) - "go to work"

**💡 Memory Tip:**

Think of a teacher calling out "bān!" to start **class** — that steady, high tone conveys authority
and marks the beginning of organized learning time.
