**🗣️ Pronunciation of 的 (de)**

- **Pinyin:** de
- **Tone: Neutral tone** — **light and unstressed**, often shortened

**🔤 Breakdown:**

- **d** like **"d"** in "do" but **softer and without a puff** — tongue touches just behind upper
  teeth

- **de** sounds like a quick **"duh"** but unstressed

**🎧 Tone tip:**

The **neutral tone** (·) is **unstressed and light**:

like how we rush through small words in English!

**📝 Note:**

的 is one of the most frequently used particles in Chinese, functioning as a possessive marker and
modifier. It's almost always pronounced with neutral tone in everyday speech.
