**🗣️ Pronunciation of 爻 (yáo)**

- **Pinyin:** yáo
- **Tone: Second tone** — **rising** tone, like asking a question

**🔤 Breakdown:**

- **y** like **"y"** in "yes"
- **áo** sounds like **"ow"** in "cow" but with a rising tone, like saying "Ow?" when confused
- **yáo** sounds like **"yow"** with a questioning rise

**🎧 Tone tip:**

The **second tone** (´) is a **rising** tone:

Say it like you're asking "What?" when encountering mysterious symbols — **"yáo?"** — that
questioning upward inflection is the second tone pattern.

**📝 Common Examples:**

- 爻 (yáo) - "divination; line in I Ching hexagram"
- 爻辞 (yáo cí) - "divination text"
- 六爻 (liù yáo) - "six lines" (I Ching reference)

**💡 Special Note:**

爻 is a specialized character primarily used in traditional Chinese divination and the I Ching (Book
of Changes). It refers to the broken and unbroken lines that make up hexagrams.

**💡 Memory Tip:**

When looking at mysterious divination symbols, you ask "What does this mean?" with curiosity — just
like the second tone's questioning pattern in 爻!
