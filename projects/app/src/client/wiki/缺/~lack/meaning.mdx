## Character Analysis

### 缺 (lack)

缺 depicts **a broken or incomplete vessel**:

- **缶** (pottery vessel) represents something meant to contain or hold
- **夬** (gap/break) shows where part is missing
- Together: a container with a piece missing - symbolizing insufficiency or lack
- The visual suggests something that should be whole but has parts missing

## Mnemonic

Think of 缺 as **"a jar with a chunk missing"**:

- Picture a clay pot with a piece broken off
- The pot can't hold water properly because of the gap
- This represents any situation where something is insufficient
- Just like the broken pot needs repair, 缺 indicates something needs to be filled or completed
