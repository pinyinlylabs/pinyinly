**🗣️ Pronunciation of 脚 (jiǎo)**

- **Pinyin:** jiǎo
- **Tone: Third tone** — **falling-rising** tone, like saying "uh-huh" when nodding

**🎧 Tone tip:**

The **third tone** (ˇ) is a **fall–then-rise** tone:

Say it like you're carefully stepping: **"jiǎo..."** — that's the careful tone pattern of **jiǎo**.

脚 refers to the foot, and the third tone's curved pattern resembles the careful, measured movement
of placing one's foot down!
