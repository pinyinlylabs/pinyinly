| Component | Meaning                                                  |
| --------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| **地**    | Ground, land, earth (surface) - soil radical 土 + 也     |
| **球**    | Ball, sphere, globe - jade/king radical 王 + 求 (求 求 ) |

The combination literally means "ground ball" or "earth sphere."

## Mnemonic

Think of 地球 as **"the ground shaped like a ball"**:

- 地 (dì) represents the ground, soil, land we stand on
- 球 (qiú) represents a round ball or sphere
- Together: the ground/earth that forms a spherical ball
- Picture looking at Earth from space - all the land (地) formed into a ball (球)
- The solid ground beneath our feet that's actually part of a giant sphere

This creates the image: **the land we live on is actually a giant ball floating in space**.
