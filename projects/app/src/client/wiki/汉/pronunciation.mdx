**🗣️ Pronunciation of 汉 (hàn)**

- **Pinyin:** hàn
- **Tone: Fourth tone** — sharp **falling** tone, like giving a command: **"hàn!"**

**🔤 Breakdown:**

- **h** like **"h"** in "hat" (breathy sound)
- **àn** sounds like **"ahn"** with sharp falling tone
- **hàn** sounds like **"hahn!"** with a sharp drop

**🎯 Mastering the "an" final:**

The **an** ending is a **nasal final** with a front vowel:

1. **Start with "ah"** like in "father" (but shorter)
2. **Add the "n"** sound with tongue tip touching upper teeth
3. **Keep the vowel open** — not too rounded
4. **Let the "n" be clear** — tongue should touch the roof of mouth

**Common mistakes:**

- ❌ "han" with flat tone — needs the sharp falling tone
- ❌ "hun" sound — should be "ah" not "uh"
- ❌ Missing the "n" nasal sound — should end with clear "n"
- ❌ Weak falling tone — should be sharp and decisive
- ✅ "hàn" — breathy "h" + open "ah" + clear "n" + sharp fall

**🎧 Tone tip:**

The **fourth tone** (ˋ) is **sharp and falling**:

Start **high and drop sharply** — like giving a firm command: **"hàn!"**

**📝 Practice words:**

- 汉语 (hàn yǔ) - "Chinese language"
- 汉字 (hàn zì) - "Chinese characters"
- 汉族 (hàn zú) - "Han Chinese (ethnicity)"
- 好汉 (hǎo hàn) - "good fellow; hero"

**💡 Memory Tip:**

Think of someone proudly declaring **"Han!"** (like the dynasty) with authority and confidence —
that sharp, falling tone shows strength and decisiveness!
