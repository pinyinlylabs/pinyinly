**🗣️ Pronunciation of 写 (xiě)**

- **Pinyin:** xiě
- **Tone: Third tone** — **falling-rising** tone, like saying "uh-huh" when nodding

**🔤 Breakdown:**

- **x** — This is like **"sh"** but with your tongue curled back slightly
- **iě** sounds like **"yeh"** but with the **third tone** → dip down and rise up
- **xiě** sounds like **"sh-yeh"** with a dip-then-rise

**🎯 Mastering the "x" sound:**

The **x** in Chinese is **not** like English "x" (ks). Instead:

1. **Start with "sh"** like in "she"
2. **Curl your tongue back** just a little bit
3. **Keep it soft** — not as harsh as "sh"
4. **Think of a gentle, retroflex "sh"**

**🎧 Tone tip:**

The **third tone** (ˇ) is a **fall–then-rise** tone:

Say it like you're thinking about what to write: **"xiě..."** — that thoughtful, contemplative tone.

**📝 Common Examples:**

- 写 (xiě) - "to write"
- 写作 (xiě zuò) - "writing; composition"
- 书写 (shū xiě) - "to write; handwriting"
- 描写 (miáo xiě) - "to describe"

**💡 Memory Tip:**

When you're writing, you pause and think — your voice naturally dips down then rises as you consider
your words!
