**🗣️ Pronunciation of 写 (xiě)**

- **Pinyin:** xiě
- **Tone: Third tone** — **falling-rising** tone, like expressing mild surprise: **"Oh?"**

**🔤 Breakdown:**

- **x** like **"sh"** in "she" but **lighter** and more **forward** (same as in 想)
- **iě** sounds like **"ee-eh"** blended together with third tone
- **xiě** sounds like **"shee-eh"** with a dip-then-rise tone

**🎯 Mastering the "x" sound:**

The **x** in Chinese is consistent across characters:

1. **Soft "sh"** — like whispering "she"
2. **Tongue forward** — tip behind lower teeth
3. **Light and airy** — not harsh like English "sh"
4. **Think gentle "sh"** — almost like a soft "s" with air

**🎯 Mastering the "iě" final:**

The **iě** is a **diphthong** with third tone:

1. **Start with "ee"** like in "see"
2. **Quickly shift to "eh"** like in "bed"
3. **Blend smoothly** — no pause between sounds
4. **Apply third tone** — dip low then rise through the transition

**Common mistakes:**

- ❌ "shay" with English "sh" — needs softer "x" sound
- ❌ "see-eh" (two syllables) — should be one smooth sound
- ❌ "xiè" with fourth tone — should be third tone (falling-rising)
- ✅ "xiě" — soft "x" + smooth "ee-eh" + third tone

**🎧 Tone tip:**

The **third tone** (ˇ) expresses **mild questioning or surprise**:

**Dip down then rise** — like saying "Oh?" when someone tells you something unexpected: **"xiě?"**

**📝 Practice words:**

- 写 (xiě) - "write"
- 写字 (xiě zì) - "write characters"
- 书写 (shū xiě) - "writing; to write"
- 描写 (miáo xiě) - "describe; depict"

**💡 Memory Tip:**

Think of the motion of writing — your hand **dips down then comes up** — just like the third tone
of 写!
