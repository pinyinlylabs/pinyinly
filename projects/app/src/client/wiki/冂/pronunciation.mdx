**🗣️ Pronunciation of 冂 (jiōng)**

- **Pinyin:** jiōng
- **Tone: First tone** — **high and flat** tone, like a steady note: **"Oooh"**

**🔤 Breakdown:**

- **j** — This is like **"j"** in "jeep" but **softer** and more like **"zh"** in "zhee"
- **iōng** sounds like **"yong"** but held steady and high
- **jiōng** sounds like **"jyong"** with steady high pitch

**🎯 Mastering the "j" sound:**

The **j** in Chinese is **not** like English "j" (as in "jump"). Instead:

1. **Start with "zh"** like in "zhee"
2. **Make it softer** — less harsh than English "j"
3. **Keep your tongue relaxed** — don't press too hard
4. **Think of it as a gentle "zh" sound**

**🎧 Tone tip:**

The **first tone** (¯) is **high and flat**:

Keep your voice **steady and high** throughout — like humming a single high note: **"jiōōōng"**

**📝 Common Examples:**

- 冂 (jiōng) - "wide; open" (radical meaning)

**💡 Memory Tip:**

This character looks like an open frame or boundary — imagine the steady, open sound **"jiōng"**!

**📌 Note:**

冂 is primarily used as a radical component in other characters rather than as a standalone
character in modern Chinese.
