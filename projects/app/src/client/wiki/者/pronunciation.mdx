**🗣️ Pronunciation of 者 (zhě)**

- **Pinyin:** zhě
- **Tone: Third tone** — **falling-rising** tone, like saying "hmm" when thinking

**🔤 Breakdown:**

- **zh** like **"j"** in "judge" (but with tongue curled back)
- **ě** sounds like **"uh"** in "duh", but with third tone → dip down and rise up
- **zhě** sounds like **"juh"** with a contemplative dip-then-rise

**🎧 Tone tip:**

The **third tone** (ˇ) is a **fall–then-rise** tone:

Say it like you're thoughtfully referring to someone: **"zhě..."** — that's the reflective tone
pattern of **zhě**.

**📝 Common Examples:**

- 者 (zhě) - "person, one who" (suffix for people)

**💡 Memory Tip:**

**者** is often used as a suffix to describe "a person who does something" — use that thoughtful
third tone when identifying someone's role!
