**🗣️ Pronunciation of 阴 (yīn)**

- **Pinyin:** yīn

**🔤 Breakdown:**

- **y** like **"y"** in "yes"
- **īn** sounds like **"een"** in "seen" but held steady and high
- **yīn** sounds like **"yeen"** with a steady high pitch

**🎧 Tone tip:**

The **first tone** (ˉ) is a **high and flat** tone:

Say it like a steady, overcast sky: **"yīn..."** — that flat, unchanging tone like gray clouds.

overcast feeling of **阴** meaning "cloudy"!
