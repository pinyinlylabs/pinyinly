## Mnemonic

Think of 丿 as **something falling or leaning**:

- A stick falling diagonally to the left
- Rain falling at an angle
- A person leaning forward while walking
- The natural sweep of a brush stroke moving down and left

This represents the concept of **diagonal movement and natural flow**.

## Core Meaning & Usage

丿 represents **diagonal movement and dynamic action**. It appears in:

1. **Basic characters**: 人 (person), 入 (enter), 八 (eight)
2. **As a stroke component**: Provides diagonal structure and movement
3. **Balancing element**: Often paired with opposite diagonal strokes
4. **Action indication**: Suggests movement or direction

## Examples in Characters

- **人** (rén) - "person" (two diagonal strokes meeting)
- **入** (rù) - "enter" (diagonal strokes pointing inward)
- **八** (bā) - "eight" (two diagonal strokes spreading apart)
- **火** (huǒ) - "fire" (contains diagonal elements suggesting flames)
- **大** (dà) - "big" (diagonal strokes extending outward)

## As a Building Block

丿 is one of the Eight Basic Strokes (八种基本笔画) in Chinese calligraphy:
- It teaches **flowing brush movement** from thick to thin
- Represents **dynamic energy** and **movement** in characters
- Often creates **visual tension** and **balance** with other strokes

The diagonal slash is essential for understanding how Chinese characters express movement, direction, and natural flow within their structure.
