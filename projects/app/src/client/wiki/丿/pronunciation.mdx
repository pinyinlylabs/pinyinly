**🗣️ Pronunciation of 丿 (piě)**

- **Pinyin:** piě
- **Tone: Third tone** — **falling-rising** tone, like saying "uh-huh" when nodding

**🔤 Breakdown:**

- **p** like **"p"** in "pat" but with a puff of air
- **iě** sounds like **"ee-eh"** but with third tone → dip down and rise up
- **piě** sounds like **"pee-eh"** with a dip-then-rise

**🎯 Mastering the "p" sound:**

The **p** in Chinese is **aspirated** (has a puff of air):

1. **Start with "p"** like in "pat"
2. **Add a strong puff of air** — hold your hand in front of your mouth and feel the air
3. **Make it breathy** — like blowing out a small candle
4. **Think "p" + breath**

**🎧 Tone tip:**

The **third tone** (ˇ) is a **fall–then-rise** tone:

Say it like you're making a diagonal slash motion: **"piě..."** — that sweeping dip-then-rise
pattern.

**📝 Common Examples:**

- 丿 (piě) - "slash" (left-falling stroke radical)
- 撇 (piě) - "to skim; to cast aside"
- 瞥 (piē) - "to glimpse" (different tone, first tone)

**💡 Memory Tip:**

Think of making a **diagonal slash** (丿) with a brush — the motion starts high, dips down, then
rises up, just like the **piě** tone!
