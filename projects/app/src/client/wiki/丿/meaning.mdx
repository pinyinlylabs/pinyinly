## Examples in Characters

- **人** (rén) - "person" (two diagonal strokes meeting)

## As a Building Block

丿 is one of the Eight Basic Strokes (八种基本笔画) in Chinese calligraphy:

- It teaches **flowing brush movement** from thick to thin
- Represents **dynamic energy** and **movement** in characters
- Often creates **visual tension** and **balance** with other strokes

The diagonal slash is essential for understanding how Chinese characters express movement,
direction, and natural flow within their structure.
