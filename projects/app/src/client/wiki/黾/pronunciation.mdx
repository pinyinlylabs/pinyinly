**🗣️ Pronunciation of 黾 (mǐn)**

- **Pinyin:** mǐn
- **Tone: Third tone** — **falling-rising** tone, like saying "uh-huh" when nodding

- **m** like **"m"** in "men"
- **ǐn** sounds like **"in"** in "pin" but with third tone → dip down and rise up
- **mǐn** sounds like **"min"** with a dip-then-rise

**🎧 Tone tip:**

The **third tone** (ˇ) is a **fall–then-rise** tone:

Say it like you're thoughtfully observing a frog: **"mǐn..."** — that contemplative tone pattern
when watching amphibians.

- 黾勉 (mǐn miǎn) - "to strive; to make an effort"

**💡 Memory Tip:**
