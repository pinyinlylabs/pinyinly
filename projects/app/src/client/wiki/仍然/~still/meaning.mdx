## Character Analysis

### 仍 (still)

仍 shows **ongoing unchanged state**:

- **亻** (person radical) represents the subject
- **乃** (then/still) shows continuation
- Indicates something remains as before

### 然 (like this)

然 depicts **burning and clarity**:

- **灬** (fire) shows burning/illumination
- **犬** (dog) represents loyalty/faithfulness
- Together: something that burns clearly and faithfully - unchanging truth

## Mnemonic

Think of 仍然 as **"still burning with the same flame"**:

- 仍 (still) shows the condition hasn't changed
- 然 (like this) emphasizes "exactly like this" - no difference
- Like a candle that keeps burning steadily despite wind
- Picture checking something repeatedly and finding it unchanged
