| Component | Meaning                                          |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| **心**    | Heart (bottom) - feeling or intention            |
| **丿**    | Dividing stroke - something that cannot be split |

The combination suggests something that comes from the heart and cannot be divided or avoided - hence "must."

## Mnemonic

Think of 必 as **"what the heart demands cannot be divided"**:

- The heart (心) at the bottom represents inner conviction
- The dividing stroke shows something absolute, not negotiable
- Together: something your heart tells you that you absolutely must do
- Picture a firm resolution that cannot be split or compromised
- Like an unwavering decision that comes from deep conviction

This creates the image: **an undivided necessity that comes from within**.
