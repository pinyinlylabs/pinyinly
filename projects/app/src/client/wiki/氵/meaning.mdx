left component of a character.

| Component | Visual Description                                          |
| --------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| **氵**    | Three flowing drops or streams of water, simplified from 水 |
| **水**    | Original form showing flowing water with a central stream   |

## Mnemonic

Think of 氵 as **three drops of water flowing down**:

- The three vertical strokes look like water droplets falling
- Each stroke represents a stream or drop of water
- When you see 氵 on the left side of a character, think "water-related"
- It's like seeing rain drops or a small waterfall flowing down

This radical immediately tells you the character has something to do with **water, liquids, or
flowing**.

## Core Meaning & Usage

氵 appears as the **left radical in hundreds of water-related characters**:

3. **Actions with liquids**: 洗 (xǐ) - "wash", 游 (yóu) - "swim"

## Cultural Context

Water is one of the **Five Elements** (五行) in Chinese philosophy, representing:

- **Fluidity and adaptability**
- **Life and nourishment**
- **Cleansing and purification**
- **Downward flow and humility**

The 氵 radical connects characters to these fundamental water concepts, making it one of the most
common and important radicals in Chinese writing.
