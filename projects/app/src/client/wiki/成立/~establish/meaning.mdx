## Mnemonic

Think of 成立 as **successfully standing up something new**:

- 成 (complete/succeed) + 立 (stand) = "successfully make something stand"
- Like building something that successfully stands on its own
- Completing the process of making an organization "stand up" and function
- When efforts are completed and something new stands independently

This creates the meaning: **successfully creating something that stands and functions independently**.
