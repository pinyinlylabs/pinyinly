## Mnemonic

Think of 像 as **"a person showing an image or likeness"**:

- 亻(person) represents the observer or the one being compared
- 象 (elephant/image) represents the visible form or appearance being referenced
- Together: a person displaying or recognizing a particular appearance/likeness
- Picture someone looking at a photo and saying "this looks like..."

- The moment of recognition when you notice similarities

This creates the image: **recognizing the likeness between a person and an image or another person**.
