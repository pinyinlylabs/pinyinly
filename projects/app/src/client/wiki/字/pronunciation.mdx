**🗣️ Pronunciation of 字 (zì)**

- **Pinyin:** zì
- **Tone: Fourth tone** — **falling** tone, like giving a command: **"Stop!"**

**🔤 Breakdown:**

- **z** like **"dz"** — similar to "ds" in "ads" but as one sound
- **ì** sounds like **"uh"** in "duh" but with a sharp falling tone
- **zì** sounds like **"dzuh!"** with a sharp drop

**🎯 Mastering the Chinese "z" sound:**

The **z** in Chinese is **different** from English:

1. **Tongue tip to teeth** — press tongue tip against upper teeth
2. **Make a "dz" sound** — like "ds" in "lids" but as one sound
3. **Keep it unaspirated** — no puff of air like English "z"
4. **Think "dz"** — not buzzy like English "z"

**🎧 Tone tip:**

The **fourth tone** (ˋ) is **authoritative and falling**:

Start **high and drop decisively** — like pointing to a character and stating: **"zì!"** — that's
the definitive fourth tone.

**📝 Common Examples:**

- 字 (zì) - "character; word; writing"
- 汉字 (hàn zì) - "Chinese characters"
- 写字 (xiě zì) - "to write characters"
- 字典 (zì diǎn) - "dictionary"
- 识字 (shí zì) - "to be literate; to know characters"
- 文字 (wén zì) - "writing; script"

**💡 Memory Tip:**

The fourth tone's decisive fall is like confidently identifying a **character** — you point and
state it with authority!
