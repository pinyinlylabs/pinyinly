**🗣️ Pronunciation of 巛 (chuān)**

- **Pinyin:** chuān
- **Tone: First tone** — **high and flat** tone, like the steady flow of a river: **"Chuaaaaaan"**

**🔤 Breakdown:**

- **chuān** sounds like **"chwahn"** with a steady high pitch

**🎯 Mastering the Chinese "ch" sound:**

The **ch** in Chinese is **aspirated and retroflex**:

1. **Curl tongue tip back** — point it toward the roof of your mouth
2. **Add puff of air** — like English "ch" but stronger
3. **Make it deeper** — more resonant than English "ch"
4. **Think "church" with curled tongue** — but with more air

The **uān** ending combines sounds:

1. **Start with "oo"** — like in "soon"
2. **Glide to "ah"** — like in "father"
3. **Add "n"** — tongue tip touches ridge behind upper teeth
4. **Keep it flowing** — like water in a stream

**🎧 Tone tip:**

The **first tone** (ˉ) is **high and steady**:

Stay **high and flat** throughout — like the continuous, unchanging flow of a river: **"chuāāāān"**

**📝 Common Examples:**

- 巛 (chuān) - "river; stream" (primarily used as a radical)

**📚 Note on Usage:**

巛 is primarily used as a radical (部首) in Chinese characters rather than as a standalone word. It
appears in characters like:

- 川 (chuān) - "river; plain"
- 州 (zhōu) - "state; province"
- 流 (liú) - "flow; stream"

**📚 Relationship to 川:**

巛 is the ancient form of 川 (chuān), which is the more commonly used character for "river" in
modern Chinese.

The steady, high tone mimics the constant flow of a river — continuous and unchanging, flowing
steadily from source to sea: **"chuāāāān"**
