## Character Analysis

### 以 (by means of)

以 shows **a person using something**:

- **人** (person) represents the user/reference point
- **厶** (private/self) shows personal involvement
- Together: using something as a basis or starting point

### 上 (above)

上 depicts **pointing upward**:

- **一** (horizontal line) shows the reference level
- **丨** (vertical line) points upward from it
- Together: direction or position higher than the baseline

## Mnemonic

Think of 以上 as **"using this line as the starting point, everything above it"**:

- 以 (by means of) sets the reference point or baseline
- 上 (above) shows everything higher than that point

- Picture drawing a line and indicating everything above it
