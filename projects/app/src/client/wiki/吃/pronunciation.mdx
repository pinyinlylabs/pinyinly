**🗣️ Pronunciation of 吃 (chī)**

- **Pinyin:** chī
- **Tone: First tone** — **high and flat** tone, like announcing: **"Eat!"**

**🔤 Breakdown:**

- **ch** like **"ch"** in "chair" but with **more breath** — aspirated and stronger
- **ī** sounds like **"ee"** in "see" but held steady and high
- **chī** sounds like **"chee"** with steady high pitch and extra breath

**🎯 Mastering the "ch" sound:**

The **ch** in Chinese is **aspirated** (more breathy than English):

1. **Start with "ch"** like in "chair"
2. **Add strong puff of air** — hold your hand in front of your mouth to feel it
3. **Make it forceful** — more breath than English "ch"
4. **Think "ch" + whoosh** — like blowing out a candle while saying "chair"

**🎯 Mastering the "ī" final:**

The **ī** with first tone is straightforward:

1. **Pure "ee" sound** like in "see"
2. **Keep it steady** — no gliding or changing
3. **Hold it high** — maintain the same pitch throughout
4. **Make it clear** — crisp and precise

**Common mistakes:**

- ❌ "chee" with soft "ch" — needs strong aspiration and puff of air
- ❌ "chi" with "i" like in "sit" — should be "ee" sound
- ❌ "chī" with rising or falling tone — should stay flat and high
- ✅ "chī" — aspirated "ch" + steady "ee" + high flat tone

**🎧 Tone tip:**

The **first tone** (¯) is **steady and commanding**:

Keep it **high and flat** throughout — like giving a clear instruction: **"chī!"** (Eat!)

**📝 Practice words:**

- 吃 (chī) - "eat"
- 吃饭 (chī fàn) - "eat rice/meal"
- 好吃 (hǎo chī) - "delicious; tasty"
- 吃不下 (chī bù xià) - "can't eat anymore"

**💡 Memory Tip:**

Think of the sound you make when taking a big bite — **"ch"** with a puff of air, followed by a
satisfied **"ee"** sound!
