| **纟**    | Silk radical - threads that can be connected and extended |
| **売**    | Sell, exchange - suggesting ongoing transaction/activity  |

The combination suggests "connecting threads together" to create continuous length.

## Mnemonic

Think of 续 as **"connecting silk threads to make them longer and stronger"**:

- 纟 (silk) represents threads or connections that can be joined
- 売 suggests the ongoing activity of maintaining something
- Together: the process of connecting and extending to keep something going
- Picture a weaver adding new thread to continue a fabric
- Like splicing rope segments together to make a longer rope
- The action of maintaining continuity by adding new segments

This creates the image: **connecting new segments to keep something flowing without interruption**.
