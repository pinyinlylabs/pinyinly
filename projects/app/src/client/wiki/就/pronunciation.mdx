**🗣️ Pronunciation of 就 (jiù)**

- **Pinyin:** jiù
- **Tone: Fourth tone** — **falling** tone, like stating a fact: **"That's it!"**

**🔤 Breakdown:**

- **j** like **"j"** in "jeep" but **lighter** and **more forward** in the mouth
- **iù** sounds like **"ee-oh"** blended together quickly with falling tone
- **jiù** sounds like **"jee-oh"** that drops in pitch, said quickly as one syllable

**🎯 Mastering the "j" sound:**

The **j** in Chinese is **different** from English "j":

1. **Keep your tongue forward** — tip behind lower teeth
2. **Make it lighter** — less buzzy than English "j"
3. **More like "jee"** in "gee whiz" but softer
4. **Think of it as a gentle "j"** — not as harsh as English

**🎯 Mastering the "iù" final:**

The **iù** ending is a **diphthong** (two sounds blended):

1. **Start with "ee"** like in "see"
2. **Quickly glide to "oh"** like in "no"
3. **Blend them smoothly** — don't pause between sounds
4. **Add falling tone** throughout the glide

**Common mistakes:**

- ❌ "joo" (skipping the "ee" part) — needs the "ee-oh" glide
- ❌ "jee-you" (two separate syllables) — should be one smooth sound
- ❌ "jiù" with rising tone — should fall sharply
- ✅ "jiù" — soft "j" + smooth "ee-oh" glide + falling tone

**🎧 Tone tip:**

The **fourth tone** (ˋ) is **decisive and falling**:

Start **high and drop quickly** — like making a definitive statement: **"jiù!"** (That's it!)

**📝 Practice words:**

- 就 (jiù) - "then; just; exactly"
- 就是 (jiù shì) - "exactly; that's right"
- 就要 (jiù yào) - "about to; going to"
- 成就 (chéng jiù) - "achievement"

**💡 Memory Tip:**

Think **"Gee, oh!"** said quickly as one word with a falling tone — like realizing something
obvious: "Oh, that's just it!"
