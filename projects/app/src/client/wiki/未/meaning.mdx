1. **Not yet**: 未来 (wèilái) - "future; not yet come"
2. **Incomplete action**: 未完成 (wèi wánchéng) - "not yet completed"
3. **Future possibility**: 未知 (wèizhī) - "unknown; not yet known"
4. **Negation**: 未必 (wèibì) - "not necessarily"

## Examples

- **未必** (wèibì) - "not necessarily; may not"

## Cultural Context

未 embodies the Chinese philosophical concept of potential and incompleteness. In Chinese
thought, 未 suggests possibility and future development rather than simple negation. The character
appears in 未来 (future), emphasizing time that has "not yet arrived" but holds potential. This
reflects a forward-looking, optimistic view of incomplete things as having potential for growth.
