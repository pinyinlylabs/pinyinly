| **Tree shape**       | Represents a young tree with branches not fully formed |
| **Top branches**     | Short branches showing incomplete development          |
| **Growth potential** | Shows something in process but not finished            |

The character suggests something that exists but hasn't reached completion.

## Mnemonic

Think of 未 as **"a young tree that hasn't finished growing"**:

- The character looks like a tree with short, undeveloped branches
- Picture a sapling that's started growing but isn't mature yet
- Like a tree in spring that has buds but not full leaves
- The potential is there, but the development isn't complete
- Something that exists but hasn't reached its final form

This creates the image: **growth and potential that hasn't yet been fully realized**.

## Core Meaning & Usage

未 represents **incompleteness, future potential, and things not yet accomplished**. It's used:

1. **Not yet**: 未来 (wèilái) - "future; not yet come"
2. **Incomplete action**: 未完成 (wèi wánchéng) - "not yet completed"
3. **Future possibility**: 未知 (wèizhī) - "unknown; not yet known"
4. **Negation**: 未必 (wèibì) - "not necessarily"

## Examples

- **未来** (wèilái) - "future; the time to come"
- **未知** (wèizhī) - "unknown; uncertain"
- **未必** (wèibì) - "not necessarily; may not"
- **未完成** (wèi wánchéng) - "incomplete; unfinished"
- **未曾** (wèicéng) - "never; not yet"

## Cultural Context

未 embodies the Chinese philosophical concept of potential and incompleteness. In Chinese
thought, 未 suggests possibility and future development rather than simple negation. The character
appears in 未来 (future), emphasizing time that has "not yet arrived" but holds potential. This
reflects a forward-looking, optimistic view of incomplete things as having potential for growth.
