**🗣️ Pronunciation of 舞 (wǔ)**

- **Pinyin:** wǔ
- **Tone: Third tone** — **falling-rising** tone, like saying "uh-huh" while nodding

**🔤 Breakdown:**

- **w** like **"w"** in "wonder"
- **ǔ** sounds like **"oo"** in "book", but with third tone → dip down and rise up
- **wǔ** sounds like **"woo"** with a graceful dip-then-rise (like a dance move!)

**🎧 Tone tip:**

The **third tone** (ˇ) is a **fall–then-rise** tone:

Say it rhythmically, like the flow of a dance: **"wǔ..."** — that flowing dip and rise matches the
movement of dance.

**📝 Common Examples:**

- 舞 (wǔ) - "dance; to dance"
- 跳舞 (tiào wǔ) - "to dance"
- 舞蹈 (wǔ dào) - "dance (as an art form)"
- 舞台 (wǔ tái) - "stage; platform"
- 歌舞 (gē wǔ) - "song and dance"

**💡 Movement Note:**

舞 (wǔ) captures both the noun "dance" and the verb "to dance." The third tone's flowing pattern
mirrors the graceful movements of dancing.
