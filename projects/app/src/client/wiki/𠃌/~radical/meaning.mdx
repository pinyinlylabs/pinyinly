A basic structural component used in other characters. It does not have an independent meaning.

## Quick Reference

| Aspect          | Info                  |
| --------------- | --------------------- |
| Name            | 𠃌 radical            |
| Core function   | structural component  |
| Independent use | none (component only) |
| Stroke count    | 2 strokes             |

## Visual Breakdown

𠃌 is a **bent line radical** used as a structural component in other characters.

| Aspect       | Description                               |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------------- |
| **Shape**    | Two connected strokes forming an angle    |
| **Function** | Provides structural support in characters |
| **Position** | Can appear in various positions           |

## Character Analysis

### 𠃌 (structural component)

𠃌 represents **a bent or angled line**:

- Consists of two connected strokes
- Forms a basic structural element
- Does not carry semantic meaning on its own
- Serves as a building block within more complex characters

## Mnemonic

Think of 𠃌 as **"the backbone that helps hold characters together"**:

- Like the frame of a house, it provides structure
- It's not meant to be used alone, but supports other parts
- Picture it as a simple corner or joint in character construction
- Without independent meaning, but essential for character formation

## Usage Examples

𠃌 appears as a component in various characters (examples would depend on actual usage in the
character set):

- Found within compound characters as structural support
- Helps form the overall shape and balance of characters
- Works together with other radicals and components

## Grammar Patterns

As a radical component:

- **Not used independently** in words or sentences
- **Structural only** - provides framework for other characters
- **Combined form** - always appears with other components
- **No pronunciation** when used as a pure structural element

## Cultural Context

𠃌 reflects the systematic nature of Chinese character construction:

- **Modular design**: Characters built from reusable components
- **Structural hierarchy**: Radicals and components work together systematically
- **Ancient origins**: These structural elements evolved over thousands of years
- **Learning foundation**: Understanding components helps learners decode complex characters
- **Calligraphic tradition**: Even structural components follow stroke order principles
