**🗣️ Pronunciation of 设 (shè)**

- **Pinyin:** shè
- **Tone: Fourth tone** — **falling** tone, like announcing construction: **"Let's build!"**

**🔤 Breakdown:**

- **sh** — Like "sh" in "she", made with tongue tip curled up
- **è** sounds like **"eh"** in "bet", but with sharp fourth tone falling
- **shè** sounds like **"sheh!"** with authoritative falling tone

**🎯 Mastering the "sh" sound:**

Chinese **sh** is a retroflex sound:

1. **Curl tongue tip UP** — point it toward roof of mouth
2. **Keep tip free** — not touching the roof, just curled up
3. **Airflow over tip** — let air flow over curled tongue
4. **Rich, warm sound** — deeper than English "sh"

**🎯 Mastering the "è" vowel:**

The **è** is a mid-front vowel with fourth tone:

1. **Mouth half-open** — like "eh" in "bet"
2. **Tongue in middle** — not high, not low
3. **Relaxed position** — natural, comfortable
4. **Fourth tone drop** — start high, fall sharply

**🎧 Tone tip:**

The **fourth tone** (ˋ) is **commanding and decisive**:

Start **high and drop firmly** — like a construction foreman giving orders: **"shè!"** (Build it!)

**Common mistakes:**

- ❌ Flat tongue for "sh" — must curl tongue tip up
- ❌ Too close to "sha" — it's "eh", not "ah"
- ❌ Weak tone — fourth tone should be strong and authoritative
- ❌ English-style "sh" — Chinese version is more curled and deeper
- ✅ "shè" — curled "sh" + clear "eh" + sharp falling tone

**📝 Practice words:**

- 设 (shè) - "build; set up; establish"
- 设计 (shè jì) - "design"
- 设备 (shè bèi) - "equipment; facilities"
- 建设 (jiàn shè) - "build; construct"

**💡 Memory Tip:**

Think of commanding **"Shed!"** (like building a shed) — that sharp, decisive tone with the
retroflex "sh" captures the authority of construction and building.
