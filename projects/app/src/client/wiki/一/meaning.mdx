## Core Meaning & Usage

一 represents the fundamental concept of **unity, singularity, and the number one**. It's used:

1. **As a number**: 一个苹果 (yī gè píngguǒ) - "one apple"
2. **As "a/an"**: 一本书 (yī běn shū) - "a book"
3. **In compounds**: 一起 (yīqǐ) - "together" (literally "one together")
4. **For emphasis**: 一定 (yīdìng) - "definitely" (literally "one fixed")

## Examples

- **一天** (yī tiān) - "one day"
- **一点** (yī diǎn) - "a little bit"
- **一直** (yīzhí) - "straight; all along"
- **第一** (dì yī) - "first; number one"

## Learning Notes

一 is fundamental to Chinese - it appears in countless words and is essential for:

- Counting and numbers
- Measure words (一个, 一本, 一只, etc.)
- Time expressions
- Creating compound meanings

The tone changes in some combinations (e.g., 一个 is pronounced "yí gè" not "yī gè"), but this is
learned naturally through practice.
