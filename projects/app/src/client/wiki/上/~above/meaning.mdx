Think of 上 as **pointing upward** or **reaching above a line**:

- The vertical stroke (丨) extends upward from the horizontal base (一)
- Like a plant growing up from the ground
- Or an arrow pointing skyward from a foundation
- The vertical element "rises above" the horizontal reference line
- Shows movement from lower to higher position

This visual directly represents **going up** or **being above**.
