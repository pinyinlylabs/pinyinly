**🗣️ Pronunciation of 它 (tā)**

- **Pinyin:** tā
- **Tone: First tone** — **high and flat** tone, like a steady note

**🔤 Breakdown:**

- **t** like **"t"** in "top"
- **ā** sounds like **"ah"** in "father" but held steady and high
- **tā** sounds like **"tah"** with a steady high pitch

**🎧 Tone tip:**

The **first tone** (ˉ) is a **high and flat** tone:

Say it like you're clearly pointing to something: **"tā!"** — that steady, high tone is perfect for
**it**.

**📝 Common Examples:**

- 它 (tā) - "it" (for animals and things)
- 它们 (tā men) - "they/them" (for animals and things)
- 它的 (tā de) - "its"

**📍 Usage Note:**

Chinese has different pronouns for different contexts:

- 他 (tā) - "he/him" (for males)
- 她 (tā) - "she/her" (for females)
- 它 (tā) - "it" (for animals and things)

All three are pronounced exactly the same (**tā**), but written differently!

**💡 Memory Tip:**

**It** — the steady first tone is like confidently pointing at an object: "**it**!"
