## Character Analysis - Watch Meaning

### Connection to Surface/Display

- The original meaning of 表 as "surface" or "external" extends to timepieces
- Watches display time on their external face/surface
- Like clothing (衣), a watch is worn on the body for others to see
- The precision of hair (毛) relates to the detailed markings on watch faces

## Mnemonic

Think of 表 (watch) as **"precision clothing for your wrist"**:

- 衣 (clothing) shows it's something you wear on your body
- 毛 (hair) represents the fine, precise details like watch hands and numbers
- Together they create a timepiece that sits on your body's surface
- Picture a watch as delicate as hair but functional as clothing
