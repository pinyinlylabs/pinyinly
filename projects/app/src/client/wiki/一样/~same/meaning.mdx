- When two things have 一样 (one appearance), they look identical
- Like looking at twins and saying "they have one appearance"
- Everything matches - same form, same style, same characteristics
- 一 (one) + 样 (way/appearance) = one way of appearing = identical

This emphasizes **complete similarity with no differences**.
