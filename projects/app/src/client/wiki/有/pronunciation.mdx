**🗣️ Pronunciation of 有 (yǒu)**

- **Pinyin:** yǒu
- **Tone: Third tone** — **falling-rising** tone, like saying "uh-huh" when nodding

**🔤 Breakdown:**

- **y** like **"y"** in "yes"
- **ǒu** sounds like **"oh"**, but with third tone → dip down and rise up
- **yǒu** sounds like **"yoh"** with a dip-then-rise

**🎧 Tone tip:**

The **third tone** (ˇ) is a **fall–then-rise** tone:

Start mid-level, drop down low, then rise back up. Like thoughtfully confirming that you "have"
something.

**📝 Common Examples:**

- 有人 (yǒu rén) - "someone; there is someone"
- 有时候 (yǒu shí hou) - "sometimes"
- 有意思 (yǒu yì si) - "interesting; meaningful"
- 没有 (méi yǒu) - "don't have; there isn't"
- 有用 (yǒu yòng) - "useful"

**💡 Memory Tip:**

有 means "have" - when you're checking if you have something, you naturally use that thoughtful,
confirming tone: **"yǒu..."** (let me see if I have it...)
