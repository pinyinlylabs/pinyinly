**🗣️ Pronunciation of 性 (xìng)**

- **Pinyin:** xìng
- **Tone: Fourth tone** — sharp **falling** tone, like giving a command

**🔤 Breakdown:**

- **x** like **"sh"** in "she" but more fronted (tongue near front teeth)
- **ìng** sounds like **"ing"** in "sing" but with fourth tone → sharp drop
- **xìng** sounds like **"shing!"** with a sharp falling tone

**🎯 Mastering the "x" sound:**

The **x** in Chinese is unique:

1. **Place tongue** near front teeth (not back like "sh")
2. **Make "sh" sound** but with tongue more forward
3. **Keep it fronted** — like whispering "she" with tongue forward
4. **Think fronted "sh"** — lighter than English "sh"

**🎯 Mastering the "ìng" final:**

The **ìng** ending is **nasalized**:

1. **Start with "ee"** like in "see"
2. **Add "ng"** like at the end of "sing"
3. **Keep tongue back** — "ng" sound comes from back of tongue touching soft palate
4. **Make it resonate** — let the sound echo in your nose and throat

**🎧 Tone tip:**

The **fourth tone** (ˋ) is a sharp **falling** tone:

Say it like you're definitively stating someone's character: **"xìng!"** — that decisive drop
matches discussing someone's nature or personality.

**📝 Common Examples:**

- 性 (xìng) - "nature; character; gender; sex"
- 性格 (xìng gé) - "personality; character"
- 性别 (xìng bié) - "gender; sex"
- 男性 (nán xìng) - "male"
- 女性 (nǚ xìng) - "female"
- 个性 (gè xìng) - "personality; individuality"

**💡 Memory Tip:**

The definitive fourth tone **xìng!** sounds like someone firmly stating "That's just their nature!"
— perfect for this character about inherent qualities!
