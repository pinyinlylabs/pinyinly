**🗣️ Pronunciation of 议 (yì)**

- **Pinyin:** yì
- **Tone: Fourth tone** — **falling** tone, like making a decisive proposal: **"I suggest!"**

**🔤 Breakdown:**

- **y** like **"y"** in "yes"
- **ì** sounds like **"ee"** in "see", but with sharp fourth tone falling
- **yì** sounds like **"yee!"** with authoritative falling tone

**🎯 Mastering the "y" sound:**

Chinese **y** is straightforward:

1. **Like English "y"** — tongue touching lower teeth
2. **Quick transition** — move smoothly into the vowel
3. **Keep it light** — don't over-pronounce
4. **Natural glide** — let it flow into the "i" sound

**🎯 Mastering the "ì" vowel:**

The **ì** is a high front vowel with fourth tone:

1. **Tongue high and front** — like "ee" in "see"
2. **Lips slightly spread** — not rounded
3. **Keep it pure** — don't diphthongize
4. **Fourth tone drop** — start high, fall sharply

**🎧 Tone tip:**

The **fourth tone** (ˋ) is **decisive and commanding**:

Start **high and drop firmly** — like making a definitive suggestion in a meeting: **"yì!"**

**Common mistakes:**

- ❌ Rising tone like a question — should fall decisively
- ❌ Drawn out vowel — keep it crisp and clean
- ❌ Weak tone — fourth tone should be strong and authoritative
- ✅ "yì" — clean "yee" sound with sharp, decisive fall

**📝 Practice words:**

- 议 (yì) - "consult; discuss; suggest"
- 会议 (huì yì) - "meeting; conference"
- 议论 (yì lùn) - "discuss; comment on"
- 建议 (jiàn yì) - "suggest; proposal"

**💡 Memory Tip:**

Think of confidently saying **"Yeah!"** (yì) when making a strong suggestion or agreeing with a
proposal — that decisive falling tone is perfect.
