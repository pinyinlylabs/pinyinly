| **久**    | Long time - a person (人) leaning on support for duration |

## Mnemonic

Think of 不久 as **"not needing to wait a long time"**:

- 不 cancels out or negates something
- 久 represents a long duration or extended wait
- Together: negating the long wait = "soon"
- Like crossing out "long time" on a schedule

The phrase literally means "not long" but functions as "soon" - expressing that something will
happen in the near future.

## Usage Examples

- **不久以后** (bù jiǔ yǐhòu) - "soon after; before long"
- **不久之前** (bù jiǔ zhīqián) - "not long ago; recently"
- **不久就** (bù jiǔ jiù) - "soon will; before long will"
- **过不久** (guò bù jiǔ) - "in a short while"

## Grammar Patterns

不久 functions as a **time adverb**:

- **Future events**: 不久 + [verb] (will [verb] soon)
- **Past events**: 不久前 (not long ago)
- **Predictions**: 不久就会... (will soon...)
- **Sequential events**: ...不久就... (soon after...)

## Related Time Expressions

- **马上** (mǎshàng) - "immediately; right away"
- **很快** (hěnkuài) - "very quickly; soon"
- **一会儿** (yīhuǐr) - "in a moment; shortly"
- **不久** - "soon; before long" (less immediate than 马上)

## Cultural Context

不久 reflects Chinese communication style:

- **Indirect timing**: Avoiding overly specific commitments
- **Polite vagueness**: Leaving flexibility in scheduling
- **Natural flow**: Suggesting things happen in due course
- **Patience valued**: Accepting that good things take some time
