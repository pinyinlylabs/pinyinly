## Visual Breakdown

| Component | Visual Description                                           |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **厶**    | Private/self (厶) - represents personal capacity or strength |
| **月**    | Moon/meat (月) - indicates physical substance or body       |
| **匕**    | Spoon/tool (匕) - shows the ability to use tools or act     |

## Mnemonic

Think of 能 as **having the physical strength and tools to accomplish something**:

- The private component (厶) shows this is about personal capability
- The meat component (月) represents physical strength and substance
- The tool component (匕) shows the ability to use implements
- Like having both the physical power and the right tools for a job
- Shows **innate or physical capacity** rather than learned skill

This creates the image: **possessing the raw power and means to achieve something**.

## Core Meaning & Usage

能 represents **natural ability, physical capacity, or permission**. It's used:

1. **Physical ability**: 我能跑很快 (wǒ néng pǎo hěn kuài) - "I can run fast"
2. **Permission**: 你能来吗？ (nǐ néng lái ma?) - "Can you come? / Are you able to come?"
3. **Possibility**: 这能行吗？ (zhè néng xíng ma?) - "Can this work? / Is this possible?"
4. **Capacity**: 能容纳一百人 (néng róng nà yī bǎi rén) - "can accommodate 100 people"

## Examples

- **能力** (nénglì) - "ability; capability"
- **能够** (nénggòu) - "to be able to; to be capable of"
- **可能** (kěnéng) - "possible; maybe"
- **不能** (bù néng) - "cannot; not able to"
- **能源** (néngyuán) - "energy; power source"

## 能 vs. 会 (néng vs. huì)

Understanding the important distinction:

- **能** (néng): Natural ability, physical capacity, permission, possibility
- **会** (huì): Learned skill, acquired knowledge, "know how to"

Examples:
- 我能跑 (I am physically able to run) vs. 我会开车 (I know how to drive)
- 你能来吗？(Are you able to come?) vs. 你会来吗？(Will you come?)

## Grammar Functions

能 serves multiple roles:

- **Modal verb**: Expressing ability and possibility
- **Auxiliary verb**: Combined with main verbs to show capacity
- **Permission indicator**: Like English "may" or "can"
- **Potential marker**: Showing what's physically or practically possible

## Cultural Context

能 reflects Chinese thinking about:

- **Natural capacity**: Recognition of inherent abilities and limitations
- **Practical possibility**: Focus on what can actually be accomplished
- **Respect for capability**: Acknowledging different levels of ability
- **Efficiency**: Understanding what's within one's power to do

The character emphasizes the practical aspects of capability - having both the strength and the means to accomplish something.
