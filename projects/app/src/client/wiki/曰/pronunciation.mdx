**🗣️ Pronunciation of 曰 (yuē)**

- **Pinyin:** yuē
- **Tone: First tone** — **high and flat** tone, like a steady note

**🔤 Breakdown:**

- **y** like **"y"** in "yes"
- **uē** sounds like **"way"** but shorter, with first tone → steady and high
- **yuē** sounds like **"yweh"** with a steady high pitch

**🎧 Tone tip:**

The **first tone** (¯) is a **high and flat** tone:

Keep it steady and high, like stating something definitively. Perfect for the formal, classical tone
of "to say."

with that steady, authoritative first tone: **"yuē!"**
