Commonly used in **spoken language** to get someone’s attention (especially on the phone).

It’s like saying “Hello?” when answering or starting a phone call. It can also be used more sharply
as “Hey!” when calling out to someone.

- **喂，你好！** — "Hello, hi!"
- **喂？你听得到吗？** — "Hello? Can you hear me?"
- **喂，你干嘛呢？** — "Hey, what are you doing?"
