- **èi** sounds like **"ay"** in "way", but with fourth tone → sharp fall
- **wèi** sounds like **"way!"** with a sharp drop in pitch

**🎧 Tone tip:**

The **fourth tone** (ˋ) is a **sharp fall**:

Say it like calling attention or answering the phone: **"wèi!"** — that commanding drop.

**📝 Common Examples:**

- 喂 (wèi) - "to feed"
- 喂养 (wèi yǎng) - "to feed and raise"

2. **To feed**: The verb meaning to give food to someone/something

Both use the same pronunciation: **wèi** (fourth tone).

**💡 Memory Tip:**

The **mouth (口)** plus **畏** — whether you're calling **"hello!"** or **feeding** someone, you use
your mouth with that sharp, attention-getting "wèi!" tone!
