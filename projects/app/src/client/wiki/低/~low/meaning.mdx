## Visual Breakdown

低 combines the concept of **a person with a foundation or base**.

| Component | Visual Description                          |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| **亻**    | Person radical - representing a human being |
| **氐**    | Foundation/base - the bottom or lowest part |

## Mnemonic

Think of 低 as **a person (亻) at the base level (氐)**:

- A person standing at the bottom or foundation level
- Like someone positioned at ground level rather than elevated
- The foundation (氐) represents the lowest, most basic position
- Imagine a person standing in a valley rather than on a mountain
- Being at the base level - literally or metaphorically low

This creates the image of **being positioned below the normal level**.
