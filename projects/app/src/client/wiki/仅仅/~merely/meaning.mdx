Think of 仅仅 as **"just this, just this - nothing more!"**:

- 仅 (jǐn) means "only" or "merely"
- Repeating it (仅仅) emphasizes the limitation even more strongly
- Together: absolutely nothing beyond this small amount
- Picture holding up one finger to say "just this one thing"
- Like emphasizing how minimal or restricted something is
- The repetition makes the limitation crystal clear

This creates the image: **emphatic restriction to the bare minimum**.
