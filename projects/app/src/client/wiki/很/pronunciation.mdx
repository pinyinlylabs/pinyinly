**🗣️ Pronunciation of 很 (hěn)**

- **Pinyin:** hěn
- **Tone: Third tone** — **falling-rising** tone, like saying "uh-huh" when nodding

**🔤 Breakdown:**

- **h** like **"h"** in "hat"
- **ěn** sounds like **"un"** in "fun" but with third tone → dip down and rise up
- **hěn** sounds like **"hun"** with a dip-then-rise

**🎧 Tone tip:**

The **third tone** (ˇ) is a **fall–then-rise** tone:

Say it like you're emphasizing how much you agree: **"hěn..."** — that's the emphatic tone pattern
of **hěn**.

**📝 Common Examples:**

- 很 (hěn) - "very; quite"
- 很好 (hěn hǎo) - "very good"
- 很多 (hěn duō) - "very many; a lot"
- 很快 (hěn kuài) - "very fast"
- 很忙 (hěn máng) - "very busy"

**💡 Memory Tip:**

Think of **"hun"** with a thoughtful dip-rise — when saying something is **very** good, you often
emphasize it contemplatively, just like the third tone's pattern!
