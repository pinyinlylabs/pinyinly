**🗣️ Pronunciation of 不**

不 has **tone change rules** that affect how it's pronounced:

**📍 bù (fourth tone) - default pronunciation**

- **Pinyin:** bù
- **Tone: Fourth tone** — sharp **falling** tone, like giving a command: **"No!"**

**🔤 Breakdown:**

- **b** like **"b"** in "but"
- **ù** sounds like **"oo"** in "book" but with a sharp falling tone
- **bù** sounds like **"boo!"** with a sharp drop

**📍 bú (second tone) - before fourth tone**

- **Pinyin:** bú
- **Tone: Second tone** — **rising** tone, like asking a question

**🔤 Breakdown:**

- **b** like **"b"** in "but"
- **ú** sounds like **"oo"** in "book" but with a rising tone
- **bú** sounds like **"boo?"** with a questioning rise

**🎧 Tone Change Rules:**

**不 changes to second tone (bú) when followed by a fourth tone:**

- 不是 → **bú** shì (not "bù shì")
- 不对 → **bú** duì (not "bù duì")
- 不要 → **bú** yào (not "bù yào")
- 不错 → **bú** cuò (not "bù cuò")

**不 stays fourth tone (bù) before other tones:**

- 不好 (bù hǎo) - "not good" (third tone follows)
- 不来 (bù lái) - "not coming" (second tone follows)
- 不多 (bù duō) - "not much" (first tone follows)

**📝 Common Examples:**

**bú (second tone before fourth tone):**

- 不是 (bú shì) - "is not"
- 不对 (bú duì) - "wrong"
- 不要 (bú yào) - "don't want"
- 不用 (bú yòng) - "don't need"

**bù (fourth tone in other cases):**

- 不好 (bù hǎo) - "not good"
- 不行 (bù xíng) - "won't work"
- 不能 (bù néng) - "cannot"

**💡 Memory Tip:**

Think of it as avoiding a "tone crash" — when 不 meets another fourth tone, it rises up (second
tone) to avoid the collision!
