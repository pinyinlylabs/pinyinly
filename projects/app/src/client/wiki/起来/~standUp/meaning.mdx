## Character Analysis: 起

起 shows **self (己) + running/movement (走)**:

- **己** (self) represents personal action
- **走** (walk/run) shows movement and motion
- Together: moving oneself, getting into motion

## Character Analysis: 来

来 depicts **grain plant with hanging seeds**:

- Originally showed a plant with drooping grain
- Evolved to mean "come" as grain comes to ripeness
- In 起来, it shows movement toward completion or the speaker

## Mnemonic

Think of 起来 as **"self-movement toward here"**:

- 起 (rise) shows getting up from a lower position
- 来 (come) shows the movement is toward where you are
- Picture someone sitting down, then standing up and coming toward you
- The motion goes both up (起) and toward the observer (来)
