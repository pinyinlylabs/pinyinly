- Shows the concept of adding something else to what already exists
- Similar to saying "this one too" or "include this as well"
- The vessel shape suggests capacity to hold more

## Grammar Notes

也 is essential for adding information and making connections:

- Always comes before the verb it modifies
- Used to show similarity or addition to what was previously mentioned
- Can mean "even" in certain contexts
- Essential for making comparisons and showing parallel situations
- Critical for building coherent conversations and logical flow

## Cultural Context

也 reflects the Chinese tendency to find common ground and show inclusion, demonstrating how ideas
and people can be connected and united rather than separated.
