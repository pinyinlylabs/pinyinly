**🗣️ Pronunciation of 庭 (tíng)**

- **Pinyin:** tíng
- **Tone: Second tone** — **rising** tone, like asking a question

**🔤 Breakdown:**

- **t** like **"t"** in "top" but with a slight puff of air
- **íng** sounds like **"eeng"** with second tone → rising pitch
- **tíng** sounds like **"teeng?"** with a questioning rise

**🎧 Tone tip:**

The **second tone** (ˊ) is a **rising** tone:

Start mid-low and rise up, like when you ask "Really?" in surprise. **tíng** should have that upward
questioning intonation.

**📝 Common Examples:**

- 庭院 (tíng yuàn) - "courtyard"
- 法庭 (fǎ tíng) - "court; courtroom"
- 家庭 (jiā tíng) - "family; household"
- 庭审 (tíng shěn) - "court hearing"

**💡 Memory Tip:**

庭 means "court" — imagine asking "Court?" with that **rising intonation** when you're not sure if
you're in the right place!
