The most basic meaning of **面** is the **face** — your actual physical face, or someone’s
figurative “face” in a social or emotional sense.

**Examples**:

- 她的**面**很漂亮。(_Her face is beautiful._)
- 他低下了**面**，不敢看我。(_He lowered his face, not daring to look at me._)
- 保住**面**子是他最大的在意。(_Saving face is what he cares most about._)

This is often used with the word **面子** (miànzi), meaning **reputation**, **dignity**, or **saving
face**, especially in Chinese social culture.

This is the most literal meaning: **face**. It's used for both the physical face and for ideas like
_saving face_ or _losing face_, which are culturally important in Chinese.

==面== here shows up in words like **面子** (dignity) and **当面** (in person). It's about
**presentation**, **image**, and the **front** people see.
