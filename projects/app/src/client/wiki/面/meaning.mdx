**面** is a versatile and visual character that shows up all over Chinese — from faces to directions
to delicious bowls of noodles. It originally referred to a **flat surface** or **the front of
something**, and that idea still carries through in all its meanings. Learning 面 is like opening a
door to a whole 面 (side!) of the language that’s everywhere once you notice it.
