**🗣️ Pronunciation of 请 (qǐng)**

- **Pinyin:** qǐng
- **Tone: Third tone** — **dipping** tone, like a polite request: **"cheeng~"**

**🔤 Breakdown:**

- **q** like **"ch"** in "cheap" but **harder** and **more aspirated** — tongue further back
- **ǐng** sounds like **"eeng"** with a dipping tone
- **qǐng** sounds like **"cheeng~"** with a polite dip

**🎯 Mastering the "q" sound:**

The **q** in Chinese is **not** like English "q":

1. **Think "ch" but harder** — like "ch" in "cheap" but with more force
2. **Tongue further back** — tip of tongue touches the roof of your mouth further back
3. **Strong aspiration** — feel a strong puff of air on your hand
4. **Sharp and crisp** — make it clean and distinct

**🎧 Tone tip:**

The **third tone** (ˇ) is a **dipping** tone:

Start **mid-level, dip down low, then rise back up** like a valley: **"qǐng~"**

Perfect for polite requests — the dip makes it sound humble and respectful!

**📝 Common Examples:**

- 请 (qǐng) - "please; invite"
- 请问 (qǐng wèn) - "excuse me" (polite inquiry)
- 请进 (qǐng jìn) - "please come in"
- 请坐 (qǐng zuò) - "please sit down"

**💡 Memory Tip:**

Think **"ching~"** with that polite dipping tone — like humbly saying "ching, could you please..."
with respectful intonation!
