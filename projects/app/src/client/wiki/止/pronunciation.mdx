**🗣️ Pronunciation of 止 (zhǐ)**

- **Pinyin:** zhǐ
- **Tone: Third tone** — **falling-rising** tone, like saying "uh-huh" when nodding

**🔤 Breakdown:**

- **zh** like **"j"** in "judge" (but with tongue curled back)
- **ǐ** sounds like **"uh"** with third tone → dip down and rise up
- **zhǐ** sounds like **"juh"** with a dip-then-rise

**🎧 Tone tip:**

The **third tone** (ˇ) is a **fall–then-rise** tone:

Say it like you're thoughtfully stopping: **"zhǐ..."** — that dip-then-rise pattern.

**📝 Common Examples:**

- 停止 (tíng zhǐ) - "to stop; to halt"
- 阻止 (zǔ zhǐ) - "to prevent; to block"
- 禁止 (jìn zhǐ) - "to forbid; to prohibit"
- 制止 (zhì zhǐ) - "to stop; to restrain"

**💡 Memory Tip:**

止 means "stop" — say it with that **thoughtful dip-and-rise** like you're considering whether to
stop!
