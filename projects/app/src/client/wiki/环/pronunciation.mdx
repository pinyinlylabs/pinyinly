**🗣️ Pronunciation of 环 (huán)**

- **Pinyin:** huán
- **Tone: Second tone** — **rising** tone, like asking about a ring's shape

**🔤 Breakdown:**

- **h** like **"h"** in "hat" but softer
- **uán** sounds like **"wahn"** with rising tone
- **huán** sounds like **"hwahn"** with circular rise

**🎯 Mastering the "h" sound:**

The **h** in Chinese is:

1. **Softer than English** — more of a gentle breath
2. **From the throat** — not harsh or forced
3. **Light and airy** — like sighing softly
4. **Brief** — don't linger on it

**🎯 Mastering the "uán" final:**

The **uán** combines:

1. **"u"** like "oo" in "boot" but very brief
2. **"an"** like "ahn" with tongue forward for "n"
3. **Rising tone** — starts low and curves up like a ring
4. **Smooth transition** — "u" glides quickly into "an"

**🎧 Tone tip:**

The **second tone** (ˊ) **rises** in a curve:

Start **low and arc up** — like tracing the shape of a ring: "huán?"

**📝 Practice words:**

- 环 (huán) - "ring; circle; environment"
- 环保 (huán bǎo) - "environmental protection"
- 环境 (huán jìng) - "environment"
- 花环 (huā huán) - "garland; flower ring"

**💡 Memory Tip:**

Think of tracing a **ring** with your finger — the rising tone "huán" follows the circular, upward
curve of the ring's shape. The sound itself seems to curve upward like the object it represents.
