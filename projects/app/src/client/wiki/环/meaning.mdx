- Together: a precious circular band that completely encircles
- Picture a beautiful jade ring that forms a perfect circle
- Like a precious bracelet that wraps around your wrist
- The completeness of a circle with no beginning or end

This creates the image: **a valuable circular band that completely surrounds something**.
