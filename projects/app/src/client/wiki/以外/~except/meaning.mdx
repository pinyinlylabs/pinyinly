## Character Analysis

### 以 (by means of)

以 shows **using something as boundary**:

- **人** (person) represents the reference point
- **厶** (private) shows specific delimitation
- Together: using a specific criterion to draw boundaries

### 外 (outside)

外 depicts **divination outside the settlement**:

- **夕** (evening) shows time away from home
- **卜** (divination) represents seeking guidance
- Together: seeking answers beyond one's immediate circle

## Mnemonic

Think of 以外 as **"using this circle as the boundary, everything outside it"**:

- 以 (by means of) draws the line around what's included
- 外 (outside) shows everything beyond that boundary
- Like drawing a circle around your friends and saying "except for these people"
- Picture a fence with some things inside and others 以外 (outside)
