| Component | Visual Description                                          |
| --------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| **土**    | Earth/ground (土) - represents the surface for walking     |
| **夭**    | Bending/movement (夭) - shows the motion of walking legs   |

## Mnemonic

Think of 走 as **legs moving in a walking motion over the ground**:

- The earth component (土) provides the solid ground for walking
- The bending component (夭) shows the natural swaying motion of legs while walking
- Like someone taking rhythmic steps across the earth
- The character captures both the ground contact and the body movement
- Shows the coordinated motion of walking on solid terrain

This creates the image: **rhythmic leg movement across the ground surface**.
