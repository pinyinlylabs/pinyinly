**🗣️ Pronunciation of 首 (shǒu)**

- **Pinyin:** shǒu
- **Tone: Third tone** — **falling-rising** tone, like saying "uh-huh" when nodding thoughtfully

**🔤 Breakdown:**

- **sh** like **"sh"** in "ship"
- **ǒu** sounds like **"oh"** but with the third tone → dip down and rise up
- **shǒu** sounds like **"show"** with a dip-then-rise pattern

**🎧 Tone tip:**

The **third tone** (ˇ) is a **fall–then-rise** tone. Start middle, dip down low, then rise back up -
like you're thoughtfully nodding in agreement.

**📝 Common Examples:**

- 首都 (shǒu dū) - "capital city"
- 首先 (shǒu xiān) - "first, firstly"
- 首次 (shǒu cì) - "first time"
- 首相 (shǒu xiàng) - "prime minister"
- 首席 (shǒu xí) - "chief, head"
- 元首 (yuán shǒu) - "head of state"

**💡 Memory Tip:**

When someone asks "Who's the head of the company?" and you thoughtfully respond "Well..." - that
contemplative tone matches the dip-and-rise third tone of **shǒu**.
