**🗣️ Pronunciation of 访 (fǎng)**

- **Pinyin:** fǎng
- **Tone: Third tone** — **falling-rising** tone, like politely inquiring: **"May I visit?"**

**🔤 Breakdown:**

- **f** like **"f"** in "friend", but softer (less air)
- **ǎng** sounds like **"ahng"** with third tone dip-and-rise
- **fǎng** sounds like **"fahng"** with polite, questioning tone

**🎯 Mastering the "f" sound:**

Chinese **f** is gentler than English:

1. **Light lip contact** — upper teeth lightly touch lower lip
2. **Soft airflow** — less forceful than English "f"
3. **Quick release** — don't linger on the consonant
4. **Gentle touch** — like a whispered "f"

**🎯 Mastering the "ǎng" final:**

The **ǎng** combines vowel + nasal with third tone:

1. **Start with "ah"** — open mouth, tongue low and back
2. **Add "ng"** — back of tongue touches soft palate
3. **Keep it open** — don't close mouth too much
4. **Third tone curve** — dip down in middle, then rise up
5. **Nasal resonance** — let it vibrate in nose and throat

**🎧 Tone tip:**

The **third tone** (ˇ) is **polite and questioning**:

Like courteously asking to visit someone: **"fǎng?"** — that thoughtful, respectful tone is perfect
for "visit."

**Common mistakes:**

- ❌ Too much air on "f" — should be gentle, not forceful
- ❌ "fang" with wrong tone — must have third tone dip-and-rise
- ❌ Missing nasal quality — "ng" should resonate
- ❌ Flat vowel — needs the open "ah" sound
- ✅ "fǎng" — soft "f" + open "ah" + nasal "ng" + third tone curve

**📝 Practice words:**

- 访 (fǎng) - "visit; call on"
- 访问 (fǎng wèn) - "visit; interview"
- 拜访 (bài fǎng) - "visit; pay a visit"
- 走访 (zǒu fǎng) - "visit; call on"

**💡 Memory Tip:**

Think of politely asking **"Find?"** (sounds like fǎng) when looking for someone to visit — that
gentle, questioning tone captures both the politeness and the third tone perfectly.
