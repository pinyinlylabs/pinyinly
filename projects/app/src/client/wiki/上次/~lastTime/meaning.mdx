| Component | Visual Description                                           |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **上**    | Up/previous - shows movement to earlier position             |
| **次**    | Time/occasion - represents a specific instance or occurrence |

## Mnemonic

Think of 上次 as **"the time that came before (上) this one"**:

- 上 shows reference to the previous position in sequence
- 次 represents a specific occurrence or instance
- Together: the previous occasion when something happened
- Like looking up to an earlier event on your timeline

The concept captures past temporal reference for repeated activities.

## Usage Examples

- **上次见面** (shàng cì jiàn miàn) - "last time we met"
- **上次说过** (shàng cì shuō guò) - "mentioned last time"
- **上次的事** (shàng cì de shì) - "last time's matter"
- **比上次好** (bǐ shàng cì hǎo) - "better than last time"

## Time Sequence Pattern

上次 completes the temporal reference system:

- **上上次** (shàng shàng cì) - the time before last
- **上次** (shàng cì) - last time
- **这次** (zhè cì) - this time
- **下次** (xià cì) - next time

## Grammar Patterns

上次 functions as a **time adverb/noun**:

- **上次 + [verb] + 过/了**: [verb] + last time (completed action)
- **上次的 + [noun]**: last time's + [noun]
- **和上次一样**: same as last time
- **从上次开始**: since last time

## Reference and Comparison

上次 often used for:

- **Experience reference**: 上次你怎么说的？(what did you say last time?)
- **Comparison**: 这次比上次好 (this time is better than last time)
- **Continuation**: 上次没说完 (didn't finish talking last time)
- **Memory trigger**: 上次见到他... (last time I saw him...)

## Cultural Context

上次 reflects Chinese communication patterns:

- **Shared memory**: Building on previous shared experiences
- **Relationship continuity**: Acknowledging ongoing interactions
- **Progress tracking**: Comparing current situation to past
- **Social accountability**: Referencing previous commitments or conversations
