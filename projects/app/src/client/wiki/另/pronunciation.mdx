**🗣️ Pronunciation of 另 (lìng)**

- **Pinyin:** lìng
- **Tone: Fourth tone** — sharp **falling** tone, like giving a command

**🔤 Breakdown:**

- **l** like **"l"** in "light"
- **ìng** sounds like **"ing"** in "sing" but with fourth tone → sharp falling
- **lìng** sounds like **"ling"** with a sharp drop

**🎧 Tone tip:**

The **fourth tone** (ˋ) is a **sharp falling** tone:

Say it like you're pointing to something else: **"lìng!"** — that's the decisive tone pattern of
**lìng**.

**📝 Common Examples:**

- 另 (lìng) - "another; other; separate"
- 另外 (lìng wài) - "in addition; besides"
- 另一个 (lìng yī gè) - "another one"
- 另一方面 (lìng yī fāng miàn) - "on the other hand"
- 另类 (lìng lèi) - "alternative; different"

**💡 Memory Tip:**

Think of **"ling"** with a sharp drop — when pointing to **another** option, you often speak
decisively, just like the fourth tone!
