- Picture yourself reaching across a counter to buy something

## Cultural Context

买 reflects the central role of commerce in Chinese culture, which has a long history of trade and
entrepreneurship. The concept of fair exchange and mutual benefit in transactions is deeply valued.
In modern China, shopping (买东西) has become both a practical necessity and social activity. The
phrase "买方市场" (mǎifāng shìchǎng) - "buyer's market" - shows how economic concepts integrate the
character. Traditional Chinese business culture emphasizes relationship-building even in simple
buying transactions, viewing commerce as creating ongoing connections rather than just one-time
exchanges.
