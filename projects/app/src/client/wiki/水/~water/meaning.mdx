## Visual Breakdown

水 represents **flowing water** in a stylized form.

| Component | Visual Description                                              |
| --------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **水**    | A central vertical line with curved flowing lines on both sides |

## Mnemonic

Think of 水 as **a stream of water flowing downward**:

- The middle vertical line (丨) is the main water flow
- The curved side strokes represent water splashing and flowing outward
- Like a waterfall or fountain with water cascading down and spreading
- Water flowing down a channel with splashes on both sides

Imagine watching water flow down from above - you'd see the main stream with water droplets and
currents spreading to the sides.

2. **For bodies of water**: 河水 (hé shuǐ) - "river water"
3. **Liquid substances**: 口水 (kǒu shuǐ) - "saliva"

- Associated with wisdom, flexibility, and persistence
- **风水** (fēng shuǐ) - "wind and water" (geomancy)

## Learning Notes

水 is absolutely essential because:

- Fundamental element in Chinese philosophy and daily life
- One of the most common radicals (氵 appears in hundreds of characters)
- Essential for talking about drinks, weather, and natural phenomena
- Key to understanding Chinese environmental and cultural concepts
- Teaches how abstract concepts (flow, adaptability) relate to concrete characters

水 demonstrates how Chinese characters capture both the physical and philosophical essence of
fundamental elements!
