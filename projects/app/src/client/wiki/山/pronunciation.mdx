**🗣️ Pronunciation of 山 (shān)**

- **Pinyin:** shān
- **Tone: First tone** — **high and flat** tone, like looking at a majestic mountain: **"Ahhhh"**

**🔤 Breakdown:**

- **sh** like **"sh"** in "she" but with tongue tip curled back slightly
- **ān** sounds like **"ahn"** in "father" but held steady and high
- **shān** sounds like **"shahn"** with a steady high pitch

**🎯 Mastering the Chinese "sh" sound:**

The **sh** in Chinese is **slightly retroflex**:

1. **Start with English "sh"** — like in "shoe"
2. **Curl tongue back slightly** — tip pointing toward roof of mouth
3. **Make it deeper** — more resonant than English "sh"
4. **Keep it soft** — not harsh or hissing

**🎯 Mastering the "ān" final:**

The **ān** ending combines vowel + nasal:

1. **Start with "ah"** — like in "father"
2. **Add "n"** — tongue tip touches the ridge behind upper teeth
3. **Keep it clear** — crisp "n" ending
4. **Stay high and flat** — first tone throughout

**🎧 Tone tip:**

The **first tone** (ˉ) is **high and steady**:

Stay **high and flat** throughout — like the unchanging, majestic presence of a mountain against the
sky.
