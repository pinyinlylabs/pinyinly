**🗣️ Pronunciation of 输 (shū)**

- **Pinyin:** shū
- **Tone: First tone** — **high level** tone, steady and flat

**🔤 Breakdown:**

- **sh** — A "sh" sound with tongue curled back (retroflex)
- **ū** — A pure "oo" sound like in "food" with first tone → high and steady
- **shū** — Like "shoo" with retroflex tongue position and high flat tone

**🎯 Mastering the "sh" sound:**

The **sh** in Chinese is **retroflex**:

1. **Curl tongue back** — tip pointing toward roof of mouth
2. **Create hollow space** — tongue position creates cavity underneath
3. **Not like English "sh"** — English "sh" has tongue more forward
4. **Airflow through gap** — gentle air stream through curved tongue
5. **Practice with "zh"** — start with "zh" then add airflow for "sh"

**🎯 Mastering the "ū" vowel:**

The **ū** sound is a **high back vowel**:

1. **Round lips** — like whistling or saying "oo"
2. **Tongue back** — pull tongue toward back of mouth
3. **Pure sound** — don't let it drift to other vowel sounds
4. **Deep resonance** — sound comes from back of throat
5. **Maintain position** — keep rounded lips throughout

**Common mistakes:**

- ❌ English "sh" — tongue too forward, not retroflex enough
- ❌ "shoe" pronunciation — should be pure "oo", not diphthong
- ❌ Flat or changing tone — must stay high and level
- ❌ Unrounded lips — needs proper lip rounding for "ū"
- ✅ "shū" — retroflex "sh" + pure "oo" + steady high tone

**🎧 Tone tip:**

The **first tone** (¯) is **high and level**:

Keep it **steady at high pitch** — like a constant stream: **"shū!"**

输 can mean "to lose" or "to transport" — the **steady high tone** is like the consistent flow of
something being transported or lost!
