## Visual Breakdown

输 represents the concept of transporting or conveying something away - thus "losing."

| Component | Meaning                                  |
| --------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| **车**    | Vehicle; transport radical (on the left) |
| **俞**    | To approve; to pass through; to flow     |

The combination suggests something being transported away or flowing out of your possession.

## Mnemonic

Think of 输 as **"transporting your victory away"**:

- The vehicle (车) carries something away from you
- What flows away (俞) is your chance to win
- Picture your success being loaded onto a truck and driven away
- Like watching your winning streak leave in a vehicle
- The transport takes away what you hoped to keep

This creates the image: **your victory being transported away from you**.
