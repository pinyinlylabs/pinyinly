**🗣️ Pronunciation of 鼓 (gǔ)**

- **Pinyin:** gǔ
- **Tone: Third tone** — **falling-rising** tone, like saying "uh-huh" when nodding

**🔤 Breakdown:**

- **g** like **"g"** in "good"
- **ǔ** sounds like **"oo"** in "book" but with third tone → dip down and rise up
- **gǔ** sounds like **"goo"** with a dip-then-rise

**🎧 Tone tip:**

The **third tone** (ˇ) is a **fall–then-rise** tone:

Say it like the deep, resonant sound of a drum: **"gǔ..."** — that low, rising boom that drums make.

**📝 Common Examples:**

- 鼓 (gǔ) - "drum"
- 打鼓 (dǎ gǔ) - "to play the drum"
- 鼓声 (gǔ shēng) - "drum sound"
- 鼓励 (gǔ lì) - "to encourage"
- 腰鼓 (yāo gǔ) - "waist drum"

**💡 Memory Tip:**

鼓 with its deep third tone perfectly mimics the low, resonant **"gǔ"** boom of a drum — that
characteristic fall-then-rise sound that drums make when struck!
