## Cultural Context

争 reflects the complex Chinese attitude toward competition, which balances individual striving with
social harmony. While competition (争) is seen as natural and sometimes necessary for progress,
excessive争 (fighting/arguing) is discouraged in favor of cooperation. The ideal is "争气不争利"
(zhēngqì bù zhēnglì) - "strive for honor, not profit." Traditional Chinese philosophy emphasizes
that the highest form of competition is self-improvement rather than defeating others, embodying the
principle that true victory comes from personal excellence rather than others' defeat.
