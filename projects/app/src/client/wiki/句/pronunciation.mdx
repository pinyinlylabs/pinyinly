**🗣️ Pronunciation of 句 (jù)**

- **Pinyin:** jù
- **Tone: Fourth tone** — sharp **falling** tone, like giving a command

**🔤 Breakdown:**

- **j** like **"j"** in "jeep" (but softer, like "gee")
- **ù** sounds like **"oo"** in "moon" but with fourth tone → sharp falling
- **jù** sounds like **"joo"** with a sharp drop

**🎧 Tone tip:**

The **fourth tone** (ˋ) is a **sharp falling** tone:

Say it like you're concluding a statement: **"jù!"** — that's the definitive tone pattern of **jù**.

**📝 Common Examples:**

- 句 (jù) - "sentence; phrase"
- 句子 (jù zi) - "sentence"
- 一句话 (yī jù huà) - "one sentence"
- 诗句 (shī jù) - "line of poetry"
- 语句 (yǔ jù) - "sentence; statement"

**💡 Memory Tip:**

Think of **"joo"** with a sharp drop — when you finish a **sentence**, you often drop your voice
decisively, just like the fourth tone!
