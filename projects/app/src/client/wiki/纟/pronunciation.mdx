**🗣️ Pronunciation of 纟 (mì)**

- **Pinyin:** mì
- **Tone: Fourth tone** — sharp **falling** tone, like giving a command

**🔤 Breakdown:**

- **m** like **"m"** in "me"
- **ì** sounds like **"ee"** in "see", but with fourth tone → sharp drop
- **mì** sounds like **"mee!"** with a sharp fall

**🎧 Tone tip:**

The **fourth tone** (ˋ) is a **sharp falling** tone:

Say it like you're pointing out silk thread: **"mì!"** — that's the sharp falling pattern of **mì**.

**📝 Special Notes:**

纟 is the **silk radical** (simplified form of 糸). It appears as a component in many characters
related to textiles, thread, and fabric:

- 红 (hóng) - "red" (contains 纟)
- 线 (xiàn) - "line/thread" (contains 纟)
- 练 (liàn) - "practice" (contains 纟)
- 组 (zǔ) - "group" (contains 纟)

**💡 Memory Tip:**

As a **radical**, 纟 represents the concept of **silk** and **thread** — fine materials that were
historically valuable, hence the sharp, definitive fourth tone!
