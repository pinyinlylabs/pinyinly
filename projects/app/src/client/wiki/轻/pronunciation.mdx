**🗣️ Pronunciation of 轻 (qīng)**

- **Pinyin:** qīng
- **Tone: First tone** — **high level** tone, steady and flat

**🔤 Breakdown:**

- **q** — An aspirated "ch" sound but more forward (not retroflex)
- **īng** — Sounds like "ing" in "sing" with first tone → high and steady
- **qīng** — Like "ching" with aspirated "q" and high flat tone

**🎯 Mastering the "q" sound:**

The **q** in Chinese is **aspirated but not retroflex**:

1. **Strong aspiration** — significant puff of air, like "ch" in "chair"
2. **Tongue forward** — tip behind lower teeth, not curled back
3. **Palatal position** — middle of tongue touches hard palate
4. **Different from "ch"** — "ch" is retroflex, "q" is palatal
5. **Clear distinction** — practice "qī" vs "chī" to feel the difference

**🎯 Mastering the "īng" final:**

The **īng** ending combines vowel and nasal:

1. **Start with "i"** — high front vowel, like "ee" in "see"
2. **Add "ng"** — back of tongue touches soft palate
3. **Nasal resonance** — sound resonates in nose and throat
4. **Common ending** — like English "-ing" but with pure "i" vowel
5. **Keep "i" clear** — don't let it become schwa before "ng"

**Common mistakes:**

- ❌ Using retroflex "ch" — "q" is palatal, not retroflex
- ❌ Weak aspiration — needs strong puff of air
- ❌ "qing" with schwa — should be clear "ee" sound
- ❌ Wrong tone — must stay high and level throughout
- ✅ "qīng" — aspirated palatal "q" + clear "īng" + high flat tone

**🎧 Tone tip:**

The **first tone** (¯) is **high and level**:

Keep it **steady at high pitch** — like the consistent lightness of something: **"qīng!"**

**📝 Practice words:**

- 轻 (qīng) - "light (weight); gentle; soft"
- 轻松 (qīng sōng) - "relaxed; easy"
- 年轻 (nián qīng) - "young"
- 轻视 (qīng shì) - "to look down upon"
- 轻声 (qīng shēng) - "soft voice; neutral tone"
- 轻易 (qīng yì) - "easily; lightly"
- 减轻 (jiǎn qīng) - "to reduce; to lighten"

**💡 Memory Tip:**

轻 means "light/gentle" — the **steady high tone** floats consistently, just like something light!
