| **目**    | Vertical oval representing eye socket with horizontal pupil |

## Mnemonic

Think of 目 as **an eye viewed from the front**:

- The vertical rectangle represents the eye socket
- The two horizontal lines inside represent the eyelids
- The space between shows the pupil and iris
- Like looking directly into someone's eye and seeing its structure
- The simple lines capture the essential shape of an eye opening

This creates a clear image of **the organ of sight and vision**.
