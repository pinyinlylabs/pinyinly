| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |

| **曷**    | Sun setting/thirsty (曷) - shows dryness and need for liquid |

## Mnemonic

Think of 喝 as **a mouth desperately needing liquid when the sun sets**:

- The mouth component (口) shows where liquids enter the body
- The thirsty component (曷) represents the dried-out feeling that creates need for liquid
- Like opening your mouth for water after a long day in the sun
- Shows both the physical act and the bodily need for hydration
- The urgency of thirst drives the drinking action

This creates the image: **a parched mouth seeking refreshing liquid**.
