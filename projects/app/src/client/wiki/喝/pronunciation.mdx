**🗣️ Pronunciation of 喝 (hē)**

- **Pinyin:** hē
- **Tone: First tone** — **high and flat** tone, like offering: **"Here!"**

**🔤 Breakdown:**

- **h** like **"h"** in "hello" but **throatier** — produced deeper in the throat
- **ē** sounds like **"uh"** in "duh" but held steady and high
- **hē** sounds like **"huh"** with steady high pitch and breathy quality

**🎯 Mastering the "h" sound:**

The **h** in Chinese is **different** from English:

1. **Make it throatier** — like clearing your throat gently
2. **Deeper placement** — comes from back of throat, not just breath
3. **Slightly raspy** — more friction than English "h"
4. **Think gentle "ch" in German "ach"** — but softer

**🎯 Mastering the "ē" final:**

The **ē** is a **mid-central vowel**:

1. **Like "uh"** in "duh" or "the" (unstressed)
2. **Keep mouth relaxed** — not too open, not too closed
3. **Hold it steady** — maintain same sound throughout
4. **Mid-level height** — not as high as "ee", not as low as "ah"

**Common mistakes:**

- ❌ "hey" with English "ay" sound — should be "uh" sound
- ❌ "hee" with "ee" sound — needs the neutral "uh"
- ❌ "hè" with fourth tone — should be first tone (high and flat)
- ✅ "hē" — throaty "h" + neutral "uh" + steady high tone

**🎧 Tone tip:**

The **first tone** (¯) is **steady and inviting**:

Keep it **high and flat** — like offering someone a drink: **"hē!"** (Here, drink this!)

**📝 Practice words:**

- 喝 (hē) - "drink"
- 喝水 (hē shuǐ) - "drink water"
- 喝茶 (hē chá) - "drink tea"
- 喝酒 (hē jiǔ) - "drink alcohol"

**💡 Memory Tip:**

Think of the satisfied sound you make after a good drink — **"ahh"** — but keep it at the throat
level with that gentle raspy quality!
