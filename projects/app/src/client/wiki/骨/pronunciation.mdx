**🗣️ Pronunciation of 骨 (gǔ)**

- **Pinyin:** gǔ
- **Tone: Third tone** — **falling-rising** tone, like saying "uh-huh" when nodding

**🔤 Breakdown:**

- **g** like **"g"** in "go"
- **ǔ** sounds like **"oo"** in "book" but with third tone → dip down and rise up
- **gǔ** sounds like **"goo"** with a dip-then-rise

**🎧 Tone tip:**

The **third tone** (ˇ) is a **fall–then-rise** tone: Say it like you're thinking deeply about
something: **"gǔ..."** — that's the contemplative tone pattern.

**📝 Common Examples:**

- 骨 (gǔ) - "bone"
- 骨头 (gǔ tou) - "bone"
- 骨折 (gǔ zhé) - "fracture"
- 脊骨 (jǐ gǔ) - "backbone; spine"

**💡 Memory Tip:**

Think of the **deep, solid** nature of bones in your body — that matches the low dip and rise of 骨!
