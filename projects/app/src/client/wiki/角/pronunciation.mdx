**🗣️ Pronunciation of 角 (jiǎo)**

- **Pinyin:** jiǎo
- **Tone: Third tone** — **falling-rising** tone, like saying "uh-huh" when nodding

**🔤 Breakdown:**

- **j** like **"j"** in "jeep" but softer
- **i** like **"ee"** in "see"
- **ǎo** sounds like **"ow"** in "how" but with third tone → dip down and rise up
- **jiǎo** sounds like **"jee-ow"** with a dip-then-rise

**🎧 Tone tip:**

The **third tone** (ˇ) is a **fall–then-rise** tone:

Say it like you're pondering: **"jiǎo..."** — that thoughtful dip and rise pattern.

**📝 Common Examples:**

- 角 (jiǎo) - "horn; corner"
- 角度 (jiǎo dù) - "angle; perspective"
- 三角 (sān jiǎo) - "triangle"
- 牛角 (niú jiǎo) - "bull's horn"
- 墙角 (qiáng jiǎo) - "corner of wall"

**💡 Memory Tip:**

Think of 角 as a "horn" or "corner" — both have that curved, bending shape, just like the third
tone's dip-and-rise pattern!
