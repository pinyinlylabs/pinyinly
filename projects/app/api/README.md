This ensures `@expo/server` is installed in the deployment because it's not bundled as part of
`expo export`, and also allows applying patches to dependencies like `@expo/server` if there are
upstream bugs.

This is using `pnpm` because Vercel only supports Yarn 1 which doesn't support patching
dependencies. The `pnpm-workspace.yaml` file avoids `pnpm` getting confused by being in a Yarn
workspace.
