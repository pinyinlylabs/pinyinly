  # Prevent Moon from syncing `references` and `compilerOptions.paths` in the
  # root tsconfig.json. For some projects (like `app`) there are other "type
  # generating" tasks that are dependencies of `:typecheck` and need to be run
  # first.
  #
  # As such each project has its own `:typecheck` task and task dependencies can
  # be configured on a per-project basis.
